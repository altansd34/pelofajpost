<time>15 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>We&nbsp;all grew up&nbsp;listening to&nbsp;and reading fairy tales that have happy endings, like a&nbsp;wedding. But for some reason, they don’t often talk about what happens after the wedding, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;are left thinking that people are incredibly happy. However, not everyone manages to&nbsp;become truly happy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, so&nbsp;some people choose to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alone.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> think that there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;women with a&nbsp;similar story like the one from this article. So, most of&nbsp;our female readers could find her thoughts very familiar.</p><p>My&nbsp;name is&nbsp;Elena, I’m 34&nbsp;years old, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;small daughter, and I&nbsp;am <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a>. Not because my&nbsp;husband left&nbsp;me, but because&nbsp;I chose to&nbsp;get divorced.</p><p>My&nbsp;mother always told&nbsp;me, “Every girl should get married at&nbsp;least once.” I&nbsp;believed it&nbsp;because my&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;married and she has&nbsp;me.</p><p>The people that surrounded me&nbsp;believed that a&nbsp;married woman equals a&nbsp;successful woman: she has the most important thing a&nbsp;woman needs: a&nbsp;husband. The women who were not married were called by&nbsp;this embarrassing moniker “single mother.” Implying that she couldn’t even stay married, and that she has a&nbsp;child outside of&nbsp;marriage. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, it&nbsp;was humiliating.</p><p>The attitude toward women who were married and for some reason were left alone with a&nbsp;child was a&nbsp;little bit better. People felt sorry for these women, because nobody gets divorced when they are happy.</p><p>When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager, I&nbsp;already felt that something was off about this: I&nbsp;didn’t sense any infinite love or&nbsp;happiness between my&nbsp;parents. It’s hard to&nbsp;deceive a&nbsp;child. I&nbsp;could see that they lived together out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;habit. Just like relatives, like very close people, but not like people who passionately love each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1e/30a/e8f7075df08c9c7d28ee9afd71.jpg><p>I&nbsp;did get married when&nbsp;I was almost 30&nbsp;years old. My&nbsp;husband was a&nbsp;good person. However, I&nbsp;didn’t get the satisfaction&nbsp;I expected from getting married, even though&nbsp;I had completed “the most important task in&nbsp;every woman’s life.” I&nbsp;just had this feeling that&nbsp;I had made a&nbsp;wrong turn.</p><p>It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;torturing. And for several months after the wedding, I&nbsp;had <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a>. I&nbsp;didn’t realize it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the time, but now&nbsp;I know that was definitely&nbsp;it: nothing made me&nbsp;happy, my&nbsp;regular good mood was always just plain bad, and&nbsp;I didn’t care what&nbsp;I looked like. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;cry all the time or&nbsp;lie on&nbsp;the bed and stare at&nbsp;the wall. It’s strange, right? I&nbsp;did what&nbsp;I was supposed&nbsp;to, didn’t I?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83b/7ac/47e23b5daa899342515adcd998.jpg><p>Spoiler alert: we&nbsp;got divorced 4&nbsp;years later. Not because of&nbsp;the depression that&nbsp;I managed to&nbsp;almost get rid of&nbsp;over time. The divorce happened after&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;child and&nbsp;I realized that my&nbsp;husband wasn’t ready to&nbsp;take full responsibility for the child. We&nbsp;separated the things we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;do: I&nbsp;made all the decisions about the child because “you’re the mother, you know best.” And the father’s job was just earning money. I&nbsp;didn’t think it&nbsp;was the best division of&nbsp;labor.</p><p>I&nbsp;got tired, but my&nbsp;husband was against having a&nbsp;babysitter. “We’re not rich, we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;our own.” On&nbsp;my&nbsp;own. The help&nbsp;I could hope for was just being able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;take a&nbsp;shower and do&nbsp;something around the house without having to&nbsp;hold the baby for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours after my&nbsp;husband came home from work. Because a&nbsp;baby has to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;loved ones, there was no&nbsp;chance&nbsp;I could go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;work.</p><p>And once, when my&nbsp;husband went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;business trip and my&nbsp;one-year-old daughter and&nbsp;I stayed at&nbsp;home alone, I&nbsp;suddenly realized&nbsp;I didn’t miss him. There were fewer things&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;around the house and&nbsp;I wasn’t more tired, even though&nbsp;I was alone. But the weirdest thing was that&nbsp;I felt more free without him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/310/8a9/668d385dddb7527448933ee6b3.jpg><p>No, I&nbsp;didn’t just make him leave right away. But I&nbsp;asked myself a&nbsp;question: “Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;live with this person because&nbsp;I love him or&nbsp;for other reasons?”</p><p>He&nbsp;spends very little time with the baby. All the house chores are all on&nbsp;me. Why do&nbsp;I need a&nbsp;husband? To&nbsp;fix a&nbsp;car? I&nbsp;found a&nbsp;good mechanic, my&nbsp;husband has no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this anyway, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;always at&nbsp;work. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;the cleaning? He&nbsp;never did it&nbsp;before. To&nbsp;cook dinner? He&nbsp;can’t. To&nbsp;turn on&nbsp;the washing machine? He&nbsp;calls me&nbsp;to&nbsp;ask which button to&nbsp;push. To&nbsp;change a&nbsp;battery in&nbsp;a&nbsp;toy? I&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;screwdriver for that myself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31d/c36/87d12350ba8cb98e31673907c4.jpg><p>So, here I&nbsp;am alone. With a&nbsp;child. Nothing changed in&nbsp;my&nbsp;everyday life: everything was on&nbsp;me, and it&nbsp;still&nbsp;is. It’s a&nbsp;bit easier morally&nbsp;— I&nbsp;don’t need to&nbsp;ask for a&nbsp;second opinion. And the child now spends way more time with her father.</p><p>The money? I&nbsp;can earn&nbsp;it. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;buy less now than before. The only difficulty here is&nbsp;that when you live with a&nbsp;man, you automatically rely on&nbsp;him. On&nbsp;his help: financial, moral, and physical. Sometimes you get the help, and sometimes you don’t. Now, I&nbsp;just rely on&nbsp;myself. This doesn’t make my&nbsp;life easier, but&nbsp;I expected this.</p><p>Then there’s the attitude of&nbsp;<a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a>. Yes, it’s not “I’m a&nbsp;single mother.” But I’m not the miserable type who couldn’t stay married and keep her husband. I’m a&nbsp;wolf that doesn’t agree with the laws of&nbsp;the pack.</p><p>Most of&nbsp;the time, people that don’t know me&nbsp;well, feel sorry for&nbsp;me. Don’t feel sorry for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;choice. No, I&nbsp;don’t need hand-me-downs from your grown-up children, I&nbsp;can afford to&nbsp;buy my&nbsp;child all the necessary stuff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/47c/da2/d3b903562f8a4ca33062c733c7.jpg><p>The patriarchal form of&nbsp;life is&nbsp;outdated. Today, a&nbsp;single woman can’t be&nbsp;killed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;mammoth or&nbsp;eaten by&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiger. Sometimes, they try&nbsp;to, but&nbsp;I can protect myself. And now&nbsp;I feel more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman than when&nbsp;I was married.</p><p>I&nbsp;do not hate men, I&nbsp;really don’t! I&nbsp;actually like them. And I&nbsp;am ready to&nbsp;support a&nbsp;healthy <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. But the best form of&nbsp;relationship for me&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;guest marriage. I’m not pushing anything, I&nbsp;just like it&nbsp;more. Unfortunately, society doesn’t find this point of&nbsp;view very attractive and men are also programmed just like women. So, sooner or&nbsp;later, they ask the question, “Should we&nbsp;move in&nbsp;together?” No, we&nbsp;shouldn’t.</p><p>Maybe, some people think this is&nbsp;selfish. But the ability to&nbsp;not betray your own interests is&nbsp;the single best thing a&nbsp;mother can teach her child.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about this woman’s decision? Which parts do&nbsp;you agree with?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in June 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYybnKKml2Kubr%2FIp56lnV2ivLW0xKtkoqtdpLO1sc1mnJqrmZq%2FbsDHmqVmqpGewKq6xmaYZpuYnrmledOonp6smJq%2FbsPIrZ9mmV2brrW0xKtkcG5nZ35xew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-being-a-single-mother-is-often-easier-than-raising-a-child-together-with-a-father-767210.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-being-a-single-mother-is-often-easier-than-raising-a-child-together-with-a-father-767210.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-being-a-single-mother-is-often-easier-than-raising-a-child-together-with-a-father-767210.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-being-a-single-mother-is-often-easier-than-raising-a-child-together-with-a-father-767210.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-being-a-single-mother-is-often-easier-than-raising-a-child-together-with-a-father-767210.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-being-a-single-mother-is-often-easier-than-raising-a-child-together-with-a-father-767210.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-ada-vox-be-crowned-first-ever-queen-of-the-universe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-ada-vox-be-crowned-first-ever-queen-of-the-universe.html>Will Ada Vox be Crowned First Ever 'Queen of the Universe'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-is-britains-got-talent-golden-buzzer-sarah-ikumu-now.html>Where Is 'Britain's Got Talent' Golden Buzzer Sarah Ikumu Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./where-is-britains-got-talent-golden-buzzer-sarah-ikumu-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

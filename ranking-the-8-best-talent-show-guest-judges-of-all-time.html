Some celebrities are awesome in the role of guest judge and are able to establish a huge presence in the talent show circuit. Who is the best talent show guest judge of all time?</strong> <strong>Let’s rank some of the greatest and most memorable talent show guest judges ever</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-quentin-tarantino>8. Quentin Tarantino</h2><p>It feels like many moons ago that director Quentin Tarantino made his debut as a guest judge on American Idol Season 3. Music is a huge part of all of his Oscar-winning films so it wasn’t such a far-fetched decision to bring him on the show. He famously told Diana DeGarmo that he “didn’t care” that she pulled off all of the notes during her performance. Tarantino did not hold anything back during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his time on the show</a>, a lesson other guest judges should take note of. American Idol even brought him back as a guest judge again in Season 8. Tarantino has always been a huge fan of the show. The best guest judges are always celebrities who watch and appreciate the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-ne-yo>7. Ne-Yo</h2><p>R&B singer Ne-Yo knows incredible talent when he sees it. He served as a guest judge on Season 11 of America’s Got Talent. Ne-Yo hit his Golden Buzzer for magician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Jon Dorenbos</a> after being completely mind-blown by his trick. He even hilariously looked around and underneath the judging table to see how Jon pulled the trick off. This appearance paved the way for Ne-Yo’s talent show judging career. He later sat alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Derek Hough</a> and Jennifer Lopez on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Dance</a> judging panel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-joe-jonas>6. Joe Jonas</h2><p>Joe Jonas served as a guest judge on American Idol in Season 9. Jonas joined Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>&nbsp;at the judging table. It was clear that he was a bit nervous at the start and danced around hurting any of the artist’s feelings. After rising to fame on Disney Channel with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonas Brothers</a>, Jonas was more than qualified to find the next young talent. He even recognized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Todrick Hall</a>‘s “star power” during his audition. It didn’t hurt that literally all of the contestants had a crush on Jonas just like the rest of us at home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-lizzo>5. Lizzo</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lizzo</a> served as a guest judge on Season 10 of RuPaul’s Drag Race. When RuPaul asked Lizzo how she was feeling, she replied, “good as hell.” These are lyrics to her song of the same name that the bottom two queens ended up lip-synching to. It went down as one of the best lip-syncs of all time as Lizzo bobbed her head to the song. The best part about Lizzo appearing on the show is that she made a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">music video</a> for her song “Juice” with some of the franchise’s most popular queens.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-miley-cyrus>4. Miley Cyrus</h2><p>During the Season 11 premiere of RuPaul’s Drag Race, Miley Cyrus went undercover as a member of the staff. Once she revealed her identity, all of the queens were freaking out. She gave them some great advice and later joined the judging panel during the episode. RuPaul’s Drag Race is really all about embracing who you are, something that Cyrus has always done. She danced along as the queens performed her song, “The Best of Both Worlds,” during the lip-sync battle. It was the homage to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Hannah Montana</a> we never knew we needed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-chris-hardwick>3. Chris Hardwick</h2><p>We have Chris Hardwick to thank for giving <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angelica Hale</a> the Golden Buzzer during the Season 12 America’s Got Talent Judge Cuts. Hardwick brought major enthusiasm to the gig. You could tell he was excited to be there and was floored by all of the talents. It’s the same enthusiasm he has for his AMC show, Talking Dead. He was brought back as a guest judge again in Season 13. Hardwick was already a prominent face on NBC, hosting The Wall since 2016. He was the only America’s Got Talent guest judge to ever be asked back for another season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-lady-gaga>2. Lady Gaga</h2><p>Lady Gaga made all of our dreams come true when she posed as a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 9. The queens genuinely thought she was a Lady Gaga impersonator. Tears were flowing when she revealed her true identity. Lady Gaga judged a runway that was inspired by some of her best looks. The whole episode was just fun and full of life. In a special turn of events, nobody was eliminated from the episode. Lady Gaga definitely worked her magic to keep all of the queens in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-joel-mchale>1. Joel McHale</h2><p>Joel McHale is the ultimate talent show guest judge. McHale is by far, the most unforgettable RuPaul’s Drag Race guest judge of all time. He kept shouting, “Yeah!” during the Season 11 runway which was clearly getting on Michelle Visage’s nerves. It was obvious that he was excited to be there and brought his many years of comedy experience to the show. McHale has always been a frequent guest judge on The Masked Singer. His love-hate relationship with Community co-star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Jeong</a> has been a hit with viewers. They bicker like siblings and it is absolutely hilarious to watch. McHale will be brought back as a guest judge for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 6</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/160896_6073-e1634316389846.jpg alt="‘Dancing With the Stars’ Votes Cause Confusion — How Does Tiebreaker Work?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHq1tMRmb2aalajBbsDApZynrF2otbDDjKCsnqukYre2sMaeqmanlmKurbiMraCmnV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2franking-the-8-best-talent-show-guest-judges-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2franking-the-8-best-talent-show-guest-judges-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2franking-the-8-best-talent-show-guest-judges-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2franking-the-8-best-talent-show-guest-judges-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2franking-the-8-best-talent-show-guest-judges-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2franking-the-8-best-talent-show-guest-judges-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1595528-4-biggest-stage-drama-lady-blames-adekunle-gold-buying-8-p.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1595528-4-biggest-stage-drama-lady-blames-adekunle-gold-buying-8-p.html>Rodo: Man Calls Out Adekunle Gold For Buying 8 Pieces of Pepper for N1k: E No Funny at All</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./public-figure.html>Nigel Farage popularity &amp;amp; fame</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./public-figure.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

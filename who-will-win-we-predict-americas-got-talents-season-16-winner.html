Just when we thought certain contestants would dominate the competition, they crumbled in the live shows. Dark horses emerged throughout the season and they now have a real shot at winning the show. Predicting a winner has never been this hard.</strong></p><p>Ahead of this week’s AGT finale, here are our rankings for the remaining 10 acts in the competition from the best chance of winning to the worst chance. They are all extremely talented in their own right, but there can only be one winner. Who do you think will win the <a href=#>$1 million prize?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-dustin-tavella>1. Dustin Tavella</h2><p>Aside from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightbirde</a>, Dustin Tavella had the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unforgettable audition</a> this season. Performing an act about the day he adopted his son was incredibly heartwarming. Honestly, he has been flying under the radar with his past two performances. I think he is going to perform his biggest trick yet in the finale. The fact that he is so down to earth is something that America really resonates with. Everybody loves a family man. If he can get his nerves under control, we might be looking at the winner of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 16</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-aidan-bryant>2. Aidan Bryant</h2><p>Aidan Bryant is very humble and is always very appreciative when the judges give him positive feedback. The teen aerialist has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell rooting for him</a> all the way. Cowell has mentioned several times that Aidan is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top contender</a>. He has never landed in an Instant Save, which leads me to believe there are a lot of viewers out there voting for him. He doesn’t use any safety nets during his performances which is very bold and dangerous. I think he could be the runner-up if he performs something we have never seen before in the AGT finale.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-northwell-health-nurse-choir>3. Northwell Health Nurse Choir</h2><p>Northwell Health Nurse Choir obviously are not the best technically trained singers in the AGT finale. They do bring heart to every single performance on the show. I think America loves the story and message of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">frontline workers</a> who received <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel’s Golden Buzzer</a>. It’s really all about impact this season, not about who can sing the highest notes. A choir has never won AGT, but I would be beyond shocked if Northwell Health Nurse Choir did not make it to the Top 3.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-josh-blue>4. Josh Blue</h2><p>There were some points of the competition where I thought Josh Blue had the potential to be the first comedian to win AGT. He has the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest fanbase</a> on Reddit and YouTube out of all of the contestants. His act in the semifinals did not make me laugh like I was expecting to. It felt rushed, which was not his fault at all. He has strong potential to finish in the Top 5. He would need to really step it up in the finale to make me truly believe that he could win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-gina-brillon>5. Gina Brillon</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Brillon</a> is someone who makes me laugh hysterically. Mandel has praised her for always going out to perform at the same comedy clubs as him. Josh might finish ahead of her just because he won <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Comic&nbsp;Standing</a> and has a little bit more of a fanbase. Gina strikes me as someone that AGT might bring back to perform at results shows in the future, just like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Preacher Lawson</a>. I like her personality a lot. I just think she needs to believe in herself a little bit more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-brooke-simpson>6. Brooke Simpson</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooke Simpson</a> is an absolutely <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible singer</a>. Her choice to sing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Bad Habits”</a> in the semifinals was not my favorite. Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterfinals performance</a> was the real star of the show. To secure more votes, I think she needs to sing a song that has a deep emotional meaning in the AGT finale. She could make people connect with her a little bit more with a better song choice. I don’t think she needs to win the show in order to be successful. I have an inkling that performing on AGT will lead her to some huge opportunities in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-victory-brinker>7. Victory Brinker</h2><p>Victory Brinker became <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the frontrunner</a> once <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightbirde</a> left the competition due to her ongoing cancer battle. She is such an unbelievable opera singer at just 9 years old. Her last live performance was very shaky. I think she is a really talented singer, but with more training, she would be unstoppable. She landed in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instant Save</a> last week which leads me to believe she will not get enough votes to make the Top 5. She could follow in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackie Evancho’s footsteps</a> and become a huge star even if she doesn’t win AGT.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-lea-kyle>8. Lea Kyle</h2><p>I love Lea Kyle and I really do think her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quick-change looks</a> are stunning. There were a few little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">technical difficulties</a> in her last performance that landed her in the Instant Save. She does have a good amount of supporters rooting for her on YouTube and Instagram. Something about the timing of her act seems a little off to me sometimes. I think the changes need to happen even quicker. Production needs to step it up and make sure they do everything they can to ensure her routines go off without a hitch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-jimmie-herrod>9. Jimmie Herrod</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmie Herrod</a> is definitely the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best technically trained singer</a> in the competition. He did end up in the Instant Save once. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sofia Vergara’s Golden Buzzer</a> picks very unconventional song choices. Song choice is more important than ever before in this competition. Picking the wrong song can really affect your chances of winning. Jimmie’s performances are great, I just think he does get a little overshadowed by some of the other acts because of his song choices.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-world-taekwondo-demonstration-team>10. World Taekwondo Demonstration Team</h2><p>I appreciate the hustle of World Taekwondo Demonstration Team. What they do takes a lot of skill. I just don’t see this as a Las Vegas act. Sometimes they miss the boards that they are supposed to break in half. Other times their tricks are a little wobbly. They did end up in the Instant Save previously. I don’t think they are on the same level of past acts like V.Unbeatable. This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Golden Buzzer act</a> is fun but lacks the wow factor for me.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lauren-Alaina-scaled-1.jpeg alt="‘American Idol’ Star Lauren Alaina’s New Hallmark Movie is Both Cute and Cringe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZq%2BZobluw8inZLCdXaW%2FprDInKtmmZ2av6qvwKxkoKekYsGiuMSnq6xlo5qutLvNZmhvZaeeu6%2Bx0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-will-win-we-predict-americas-got-talents-season-16-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-will-win-we-predict-americas-got-talents-season-16-winner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-will-win-we-predict-americas-got-talents-season-16-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-will-win-we-predict-americas-got-talents-season-16-winner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-will-win-we-predict-americas-got-talents-season-16-winner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-will-win-we-predict-americas-got-talents-season-16-winner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./agt-all-stars-set-to-premiere-in-early-january-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./agt-all-stars-set-to-premiere-in-early-january-2023.html>'AGT All-Stars' Set to Premiere in Early January 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-team-gwens-kique-gomez-a-diamond-in-the-rough-on-the-voice.html>Who is Team Gwen's Kique Gomez?

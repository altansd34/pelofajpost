In&nbsp;most cases, our mothers and fathers really only wanted the best for&nbsp;us but still, many years later, their adult kids struggle to&nbsp;overcome the consequences of&nbsp;their upbringing. Moreover, a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;them repeats the mistakes of&nbsp;their parents who said the same phrases to&nbsp;their kids that a&nbsp;while back had also been hurt by&nbsp;the same rhetoric.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> collected the phrases and statements that hurt today’s adults most of&nbsp;all, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;figure out how much these seemingly harmless words affected their lives.</p><p><h2>“There is&nbsp;nothing that is&nbsp;yours in&nbsp;this house!”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31d/271/d7df2c50c9945d4ee351898bd2.jpg><p>Some parents are convinced that a&nbsp;child doesn’t have their own personality until they are able to&nbsp;financially provide for themselves. This means that, before this moment, they might ignore the kid’s opinion, feelings, and special needs. The toxic idea that a&nbsp;person is&nbsp;nobody until they start to&nbsp;earn money themselves, raises a&nbsp;generation of&nbsp;notorious workaholics.</p><p>Kids who, from their <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>, have absorbed the thought that nothing in&nbsp;their parents’ home belongs to&nbsp;them, and who never feel secure. Lost childhood, depression, anxiety, an&nbsp;exhausting feeling of&nbsp;guilt and shame, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;low self-esteem&nbsp;— these are just some of&nbsp;the frequent <a href=#>consequences</a> of&nbsp;this kind of&nbsp;upbringing.</p><p>A&nbsp;parental attitude like this will motivate a&nbsp;teenager to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;quickly move away from mom and dad in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;finally have their own little world, with at&nbsp;least some kind of&nbsp;stability, even if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;room in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dorm that is&nbsp;the illusion of&nbsp;their “own” place. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, these people work a&nbsp;lot because that’s the only way for them to&nbsp;feel significant.</p><ul><li>Me: “Mom, can you please knock before entering my&nbsp;room? The absence of&nbsp;my&nbsp;own <a href=# title="personal space" data-link=tag>personal space</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the reasons for my&nbsp;constant anxiety.” Mom: “What do&nbsp;you mean? It’s my&nbsp;apartment!

Even you yourself are made out of&nbsp;me. You haven’t earned a&nbsp;penny, but pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;person with a&nbsp;personality.” This phrase followed me&nbsp;from age 5&nbsp;to&nbsp;18. I&nbsp;can’t rest, I&nbsp;am dreadfully afraid to&nbsp;lose or&nbsp;change jobs because it&nbsp;might require a&nbsp;small break in&nbsp;earnings. I&nbsp;also have difficulties with expressing my&nbsp;emotions aloud. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Kseniya Gerasimyak&nbsp;/ Yandex Zen</a></li></ul><p><h2>“Stay out of&nbsp;adult conversations.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c3/c55/9ae8ce5b768cf237a4986851ba.jpg><p>For many parents, their child will always be&nbsp;a&nbsp;foolish kid and it&nbsp;doesn’t matter how old their offspring&nbsp;is (5,15, or&nbsp;50). It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;them that their child is&nbsp;not able to&nbsp;have serious conversations with adults and that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;too early for them to&nbsp;have their own point of&nbsp;view on&nbsp;anything. These parents don’t consider their children to&nbsp;be&nbsp;individuals, and their children feel it&nbsp;fully.</p><p>After many years it&nbsp;can echo in&nbsp;the fact that the grown-up kid will feel shy about expressing their opinion in&nbsp;the presence of&nbsp;adults (teachers, bosses) and will think that their thoughts are insignificant and don’t deserve any attention. It&nbsp;will prevent the kid from unfolding their talents in&nbsp;their studies, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;building a&nbsp;successful career.</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;mother adored this phrase. For example, when a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;hers was visiting&nbsp;us and they started to&nbsp;reminisce about an&nbsp;interesting movie that&nbsp;I had also watched and was willing to&nbsp;discuss, she would say, “Don’t get into the conversation of&nbsp;adults!” Once one of&nbsp;her friends said, “Why are you shutting her out? Let her speak” and the reply was the following, “She shouldn’t interfere when adults are speaking.” At&nbsp;that point, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager and in&nbsp;this phrase, I&nbsp;heard, “Don’t even try, you’re silly and don’t understand anything.” <a href=#>©&nbsp;Kaoma777&nbsp;/ AdMe</a></li></ul><p><h2>“If&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t remember&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;means it&nbsp;didn’t happen.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/47f/a69/b3d61c58bf83a971294ea49015.jpg><p>Today many of&nbsp;us know about <a href=#>gaslighting</a> and understand that the denial of&nbsp;real events is&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;psychological violence. But in&nbsp;childhood, many of&nbsp;us heard the phrase, “It’s all in&nbsp;your imagination! It&nbsp;never happened!” from our parents, who didn’t want to&nbsp;admit their mistakes.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, children start to&nbsp;doubt the adequacy of&nbsp;their perception of&nbsp;reality and the usefulness of&nbsp;their own <a href=# title=memory data-link=tag>memory</a>. It&nbsp;negatively affects their ability to&nbsp;trust themselves and the world because even their parents keep showing them that something is&nbsp;wrong with them because they remember things that in&nbsp;fact “never happened.”</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;was working with a&nbsp;client whose mother kicked her out onto the staircase in&nbsp;her underwear at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;13, saying, “Get out of&nbsp;here, you own nothing in&nbsp;this house!” Why? Because the girl dared to&nbsp;say to&nbsp;her, “This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;home too!” The neighbors let the girl wait in&nbsp;their home until her mom’s tantrum was over. When the daughter tried to&nbsp;remind her mother about this, she said, “It&nbsp;couldn’t have happened. I&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;look into our neighbors’ eyes.

That’s when a&nbsp;guideline that was supposed to&nbsp;prevent violence relating to&nbsp;one type of&nbsp;people, leads to&nbsp;the appearance of&nbsp;socially-approved violence over others.

We&nbsp;require experience, skills, and habits. Making mistakes is&nbsp;totally normal, especially in&nbsp;childhood. It’s not normal to&nbsp;transfer all the responsibility to&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid for their mistakes. After all, if&nbsp;parents <a href=#>haven’t taught</a> their offspring something, that’s not the kid’s fault.</p><p>Over time, a&nbsp;small child who regularly hears these words directed at&nbsp;them will stop trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;guilty.

From their very first steps, they give unreachable tasks to&nbsp;their offspring and kids have to&nbsp;jump through a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;hoops to&nbsp;complete them. At&nbsp;the same time, adults often forget to&nbsp;reward their kids for their achievements because it’s not a&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;feel proud but just a&nbsp;signal that it’s time to&nbsp;up&nbsp;the goals.</p><p>A&nbsp;kid who lives in&nbsp;the eternal race for the parental ideal doesn’t know how to&nbsp;value themselves and enjoy the process of&nbsp;their work. And, of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;difficult for them to&nbsp;avoid neurosis and <a href=#>stresses</a> because there is&nbsp;always something ahead they have to&nbsp;strive for. These kids are often sick and they often procrastinate and go&nbsp;off track, having gotten tired of&nbsp;whirling in&nbsp;the wheel of&nbsp;someone else’s ambitions.</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;friend’s mother would always say to&nbsp;her, “You could’ve done better.” She never praised her for the results. My&nbsp;friend could never feel happy about her achievements or&nbsp;even small victories. Because “she could do&nbsp;it&nbsp;better.” Later, she somehow managed to&nbsp;overcome it&nbsp;and started to&nbsp;understand that if&nbsp;she did something well, it&nbsp;was true and she should feel happy about&nbsp;it. Whether she could do&nbsp;it&nbsp;better and whether she should do&nbsp;it&nbsp;are 2&nbsp;totally different questions. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Irmali&nbsp;/ AdMe</a></li><li>All my&nbsp;life&nbsp;I would try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;deserve praise. I&nbsp;hardly ever heard a&nbsp;simple, “Good job.” I&nbsp;always saw the usual indifferent reactions or&nbsp;fault-findings. Eventually, I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;into a&nbsp;reserved lazy bones, who hardly ever communicates with anyone because what’s the point of&nbsp;doing something or&nbsp;speaking about it&nbsp;if&nbsp;no&nbsp;one will appreciate&nbsp;it? <a href=#>©&nbsp;kaddyd&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li></ul><p><h2>“You’ll manage somehow.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31e/77c/62a3665470874913aec8448c55.jpg><p>This phrase has many versions: from “You’ll manage somehow” to&nbsp;“You want too much.” Their meaning boils down to&nbsp;the fact that the child should forget about their dreams and desires&nbsp;— not because they are unrealizable, but rather because the parents don’t consider it&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;fulfill them.</p><p>Over time, kids simply stop dreaming because they understand that it&nbsp;will never come true. They know that instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-cherished doll under the Christmas tree, they will get a&nbsp;sweater (usually in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger size, so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;lasts longer) and instead of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;snack outside, the mother will say, “Is&nbsp;there nothing to&nbsp;eat at&nbsp;home?” (even if&nbsp;there are no&nbsp;financial issues in&nbsp;the family). Why? “Because I&nbsp;decided so&nbsp;— that’s why!”</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;was always told “keep dreaming” in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;any request (not necessarily about a&nbsp;purchase) and “it&nbsp;doesn’t matter much, put up&nbsp;with&nbsp;it” in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;my&nbsp;claims about some kind of&nbsp;discomfort.

In&nbsp;parents’ eyes, they lose the right to&nbsp;be&nbsp;little kids, even if&nbsp;the difference in&nbsp;age is&nbsp;not that big. A&nbsp;certain <a href=#>responsibility</a> is&nbsp;assigned to&nbsp;them: to&nbsp;become wiser and more independent. And it&nbsp;doesn’t matter that the kids might only be&nbsp;2-3 years old at&nbsp;that moment.</p><p>Early and forced growing up&nbsp;is&nbsp;not good for anyone. Yes, this kid might be&nbsp;more adjusted to&nbsp;life and they might achieve a&nbsp;lot, but the price for this success will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lost childhood and subconscious anger at&nbsp;parents and younger siblings. It&nbsp;doesn’t contribute to&nbsp;warm family relationships in&nbsp;any way and is&nbsp;often a&nbsp;psychological obstacle to&nbsp;creating their own family.</p><ul><li>All my&nbsp;childhood&nbsp;I kept hearing the phrase “You are older!” Afterward, I&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;give away my&nbsp;favorite book, toys, or&nbsp;candy, and forget about my&nbsp;interests to&nbsp;watch my&nbsp;younger twin sisters. The older&nbsp;I was becoming, the more my&nbsp;list grew of&nbsp;things&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;do. Clean the entire apartment, cook, help my&nbsp;siblings with their homework. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;19, I&nbsp;moved out. Today I&nbsp;only keep in&nbsp;touch with my&nbsp;parents and&nbsp;I don’t talk to&nbsp;them very often. The age difference between me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;younger sisters is&nbsp;1&nbsp;year and 10&nbsp;months. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Overheard&nbsp;/ Vk</a></li></ul><p><h2>“You’re doing it&nbsp;all wrong.

Oftentimes, it’s easier for parents to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something by&nbsp;themselves, rather than teach their kid to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;parent might think that, if&nbsp;they stop to&nbsp;teach, it&nbsp;will take more time, the child will make mistakes, or&nbsp;they might even have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything all over again by&nbsp;themselves anyway.</p><p>While trying to&nbsp;protect their child from unnecessary worry, many parents forget that household chores are an&nbsp;<a href=#>important part</a> of&nbsp;their child’s upbringing. This work helps with the development of&nbsp;self-control and self-discipline (after all, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;silly to&nbsp;litter where you yourself will then have to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;the floor), and both of&nbsp;these qualities will definitely be&nbsp;useful for children over the course of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p>Kids whose parents don’t give them a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;learn together from their mistakes feel household disabled later in&nbsp;adulthood: they feel scared to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something new and don’t believe in&nbsp;themselves.</p><ul><li>In&nbsp;childhood, my&nbsp;mom scolded me&nbsp;for peeling off too much skin from the potatoes and said I’d better not do&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. Or&nbsp;after vacuum cleaning the house, I&nbsp;was waiting for praise, but instead, I&nbsp;heard that&nbsp;I had missed something or&nbsp;that there was some dirt left in&nbsp;the corner. It&nbsp;was all finished off by&nbsp;her saying something like, it’s better to&nbsp;not do&nbsp;anything at&nbsp;all, than to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;poorly. Needless to&nbsp;say that at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;17, when&nbsp;I started to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dorm, I&nbsp;couldn’t even fry pre-cooked cutlets.

I&nbsp;remember saying to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom that my&nbsp;arm hurt a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the hospital by&nbsp;myself to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;exam. When my&nbsp;mom came home from work, she found me&nbsp;with a&nbsp;cast on&nbsp;my&nbsp;arm. “Mom, I&nbsp;told you it&nbsp;hurt. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;crack in&nbsp;the bone of&nbsp;my&nbsp;arm.” My&nbsp;husband has worked really hard to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;start telling him what exactly in&nbsp;my&nbsp;body hurts and how my&nbsp;treatment is&nbsp;going. That’s why now that we&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;kids, I&nbsp;examine them, treat them, and pay attention to&nbsp;any complaints. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Guzik Lena&nbsp;/ Facebook</a></li></ul><p><h2>“Are you reading books?

Daydreaming or&nbsp;reading a&nbsp;book seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;something to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ashamed&nbsp;of.

And if&nbsp;their parents keep <a href=#>saying</a> to&nbsp;them that their hair is&nbsp;too thin, that their nails are not straight, or&nbsp;that their nose looks like a&nbsp;potato, that’s what the kid will feel in&nbsp;real life. You can’t expect adequate self-esteem with these statements.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you should lie to&nbsp;your kid about their unearthly beauty, but highlighting good things and outlining the advantages of&nbsp;their appearance could be&nbsp;useful for many parents. Knowing their strengths will help your child feel more confident, while persistent information about their imperfections will fill them with complexes and make them more reserved.</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;mother would always say to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I had terrible legs&nbsp;— thin, ugly, and crooked. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out later, she was doing it&nbsp;to&nbsp;prevent me&nbsp;from wearing short skirts “so&nbsp;as&nbsp;to&nbsp;not draw extra attention to&nbsp;myself.” At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;18, I&nbsp;dressed like an&nbsp;old lady&nbsp;— floor-length dresses and baggy sweaters. Luckily, even this look didn’t frighten off young guys, and later&nbsp;I was told that I&nbsp;am actually not ugly, but on&nbsp;the contrary, very beautiful. Anyway, I&nbsp;was never able to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;my&nbsp;complexes completely. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Natalia Bogush&nbsp;/ Facebook</a></li></ul><p><h2>“We’ve sacrificed our whole lives for you and you are ungrateful!”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f55/c4e/959a8355c48f84b4667b5aee1c.jpg><p>Parents work hard to&nbsp;ensure that their offspring live better than they did. For some of&nbsp;them, a&nbsp;kid becomes the center of&nbsp;their Universe, around whom the whole world rotates. But it’s not the kid’s choice and they don’t have to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;paying off this debt to&nbsp;their parents for the things they invested in&nbsp;them&nbsp;— after all, it&nbsp;was their choice, not their child’s choice.</p><p>The child who is&nbsp;instilled with the idea that they are the meaning of&nbsp;someone else’s existence carries on&nbsp;their shoulders the burden of&nbsp;responsibility for the well-being of&nbsp;the adults in&nbsp;their life and a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;guilt for not always meeting their expectations. It’s like they are living “with a&nbsp;loan” instead of&nbsp;simply enjoying life.</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;diagnosis is&nbsp;“we&nbsp;did everything for you, but you...” I&nbsp;was always bought things without them actually asking me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I wanted them. Of&nbsp;course, all the things&nbsp;I got were the best. But not what&nbsp;I asked for. I&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;pay them off for all the material goods that&nbsp;I have and I&nbsp;am constantly reminded about this. I&nbsp;am always given a&nbsp;bill: your parents have done soooooo much for you but you...

Boys are traditionally not supposed to&nbsp;cry, show tenderness, or&nbsp;wear pink, while girls are not supposed to&nbsp;climb trees, play with cars, or&nbsp;play hockey. These restrictions prevent children from freely learning about the world around them and openly expressing their feelings.</p><p>What’s more, these phrases cause kids to&nbsp;form the wrong idea about each other. Boys grow up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;feeling that their female peers are somehow worse than they are because “it’s shameful to&nbsp;behave like a&nbsp;girl.” Girls, in&nbsp;their turn, feel that all boys are aggressive hooligans that they’d better stay away from.

While studying at Isidore Newman High School in New Orleans, he joined the football team.</p><p class=align-left>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">failed to become</a> a quarterback as his father and younger brothers did. Instead, he played as a wide receiver.</p><p class=align-left>There was an expectation that he would build a successful career in football. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at the <i>University of Mississippi (Ole Miss)</i>, where he studied broadcast journalism.</p><p class=align-left>Here is how he commented on this choice in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the Ole Miss students</a>:</p>I started out as a business major, and it wasn’t that exciting to me – accounting specifically was kind of an uphill battle. Then, I had a friend who said, ‘You ought to be at journalism school,’ and I never even thought about it. It looked to him like it came easy to me.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fc2ebeb13a9e492d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Logan Shroyer biography: age, height, girlfriend, This Is Us</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He also mentioned:</p>I really got a lot of value out of doing the things I didn’t particularly like, like being a cameraman or being the behind-the-scenes folks. I was always really comfortable in front of the microphone and real comfortable just talking when I didn’t have anything planned.<p class=align-left>In 1996, he graduated from the university with a degree in Broadcast Journalism.</p><p class=align-left>In 1998, he started a professional career in football. He played wearing the number 18.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, he began to feel numbness and weakness in his left hand. Following a medical check-up, he was diagnosed with spinal stenosis.</p><p class=align-left>Cooper Manning injury blocked his football career. This health issue put pressure on his spinal cord and nerves, controlling movement throughout the spine.</p><p class=align-left>Thus, even a slight hit could leave him paralyzed. Furthermore, his health condition necessitated surgery.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, he concluded his football career before his freshman season in 1992.

He became a partner of <i>Scotia Howard Weil, </i>an energy investment company owned by <i>Scotiabank</i> in downtown New Orleans. Here is how <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the ex-footballer commented</a> on his choice:</p>The energy business is kind of a good ol’ boy business.

We always have a script, but it’s kind of loose. Sometimes we follow it.

<time>30 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=# title=Music data-link=tag>Music</a> plays an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film, and in&nbsp;some cases, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;major element in&nbsp;developing a&nbsp;story and attracting viewers. You may remember a&nbsp;famous person who appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;singing superbly in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film; however, not everything is&nbsp;what it&nbsp;seems. Due to&nbsp;various circumstances, there are actors who are only responsible for synchronizing their lips and following the rhythm of&nbsp;a&nbsp;voice that belongs to&nbsp;another person.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> we&nbsp;were not left in&nbsp;doubt and found celebrities who did not sing in&nbsp;their own films. Above all, we&nbsp;found the real voices that we&nbsp;could hear in&nbsp;the final versions.</p><p><h2>1. Deborah Kerr in&nbsp;The King and&nbsp;I (1956)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c75/c23/cf29505d67bcddd7d697c3e5a1.jpg><p><a href=#>Kerr</a> received an&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar</a> nomination for her performance as&nbsp;Anna Leonowens, including her musical interpretation, even though it&nbsp;was not her voice. The real singer was <a href=#>Marni Nixon</a>, known for performing several voice-overs on&nbsp;the big screen, without receiving public credit. Nixon <a href=#>said</a> that when she signed a&nbsp;contract with 20th Century Fox, no&nbsp;one was supposed to&nbsp;know about her involvement. Otherwise, she would never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;the industry again.</p><p><h2>2. Natalie Wood in&nbsp;West Side Story (1961)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/238/210/d6ac3159999566d634011b772b.jpg><p>The <a href=#>actress</a> who starred in&nbsp;this film as&nbsp;Maria also received help from <a href=#>Marni Nixon</a> for her musical scenes. The soprano singer <a href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that the producers made Wood believe that she would be&nbsp;singing, so&nbsp;they made recordings, with orchestra, out of&nbsp;her songs. After finishing those sessions, Nixon entered the studio to&nbsp;sing the same songs with her own voice, which, in&nbsp;the end, was immortalized in&nbsp;the visual work.</p><p><h2>3. Audrey Hepburn in&nbsp;My&nbsp;Fair Lady (1964)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b04/75d/bbd33459e181247d3d5989a3a5.jpg><p>The famous <a href=#>actress</a> was chosen to&nbsp;play <a href=#>Eliza Doolitle</a> in&nbsp;the film adaptation of&nbsp;the musical, but when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;singing, her voice was again replaced by&nbsp;that of&nbsp;the multi-award-winning <a href=#>Marni Nixon</a>. “The Voice of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>” <a href=#>explained</a> that Hepburn did not want anyone else to&nbsp;sing in&nbsp;her place and tried to&nbsp;record the songs on&nbsp;her own, but it&nbsp;was decided to&nbsp;incorporate the singer’s experience into the final edit, the result of&nbsp;which is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;have been able to&nbsp;hear this whole time.</p><p><h2>4. Christopher Plummer in&nbsp;The Sound of&nbsp;Music (1965)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/367/d93/29291d58b9ac893aac143a7642.jpg><p><a href=#>Plummer</a> played Captain von Trapp, who appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene singing Edelweiss. The only detail is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;didn’t actually sing. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, the actor <a href=#>commented</a> that he&nbsp;only participated in&nbsp;the beginning and end of&nbsp;the songs, while the rest was done by&nbsp;someone else, as&nbsp;they took care that every detail resembled the original musical. The real voice in&nbsp;the Captain’s songs was that of&nbsp;<a href=#>Bill Lee</a>, a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Mellomen quartet</a>, who also collaborated on&nbsp;other films, mainly for Disney.</p><p><h2>5. Lou Diamond Phillips in&nbsp;La&nbsp;Bamba (1987)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/835/14a/aebda35ffbb08a1a167e966ae2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this biopic, <a href=#>Phillips</a> was chosen to&nbsp;revive the 1950s rock singer <a href=#>Ritchie Valens</a>. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Latin audience, the original songs of&nbsp;the famous singer were reinterpreted by&nbsp;the group <a href=#>Los Lobos</a> for the <a href=#>soundtrack</a>. Therefore, vocalist <a href=#>David Hidalgo</a> provided the <a href=#>real</a> voice heard in&nbsp;the film, while the actor was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;synchronizing his lips as&nbsp;best as&nbsp;he&nbsp;could.</p><p><h2>6. Wendy Makkena in&nbsp;<i>Sister Act </i>(1992)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fd/522/e2b5d15ec08600330996ea9db1.jpg><p>Both in&nbsp;the <a href=#>first film</a> and in&nbsp;1993’s <a href=#>Sister Act&nbsp;2: Back in&nbsp;the Habit</a>, the <a href=#>actress</a> played Mary Robert, a&nbsp;shy nun with a&nbsp;great voice. Wendy <a href=#>revealed</a> that she auditioned for this role by&nbsp;singing, but was unable to&nbsp;hit the high notes. So&nbsp;they had to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;professional. The chosen one was <a href=#>Andrea Robinson</a>, a&nbsp;singer who was also part of&nbsp;the cast <a href=#>meeting</a>, held 15&nbsp;years after the premiere.</p><p><h2>7. Jonathan Taylor Thomas in&nbsp;The Lion King (1994)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c59/26b/94648d500c9b653ece7f9b6bec.jpg><p><a href=#>Jonathan</a> did the English-language dubbing for <a href=#>Simba</a>’s character when the latter was a&nbsp;young lion, but by&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;sang <a href=#>I&nbsp;Just Can’t Wait To&nbsp;Be&nbsp;King</a> and Hakuna Matata, he&nbsp;gave the microphone to&nbsp;Jason Weaver. The actor and singer <a href=#>recalled</a> his experience and revealed that it&nbsp;was <a href=#>Elton John</a>, co-creator of&nbsp;the original music for the film, who heard him sing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;television studio and invited him to&nbsp;audition for the role. Disney contacted him and offered him a&nbsp;contract to&nbsp;sing in&nbsp;this animated classic.</p><p><h2>8. Matthew Broderick in&nbsp;The Lion King (1994)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/691/ddf/03a4075154badb6762c54f884e.jpg><p>Interestingly, just as&nbsp;they did with the young <a href=#>Simba</a>, Disney decided that another man should sing adult Simba’s songs, and the responsibility was given to&nbsp;<a href=#>Joseph Williams</a>, lead singer of&nbsp;the band <a href=#>Toto</a>. Matthew <a href=#>believes</a> that he&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;polish his voice well enough for the songs, even though he&nbsp;made 2&nbsp;recordings. Williams <a href=#>mentioned</a> that he&nbsp;was called up&nbsp;because he&nbsp;could reach the registers to&nbsp;sing Hakuna Matata.</p><p><h2>9. Jennifer Lopez in&nbsp;Selena (1997)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77d/940/26edb95ceb80bb12405e1c6ee9.jpg><p>This film was one of&nbsp;the stepping stones that projected <a href=#>J.Lo</a>’s artistic career, even though she did not sing in&nbsp;it. At&nbsp;the time, the actress <a href=#>confessed</a> that she did not consider herself a&nbsp;singer, and this was <a href=#>reinforced</a> by&nbsp;producer <a href=#>Gregory Nava</a> in&nbsp;2020, so&nbsp;they used <a href=#>Selena</a>’s real songs for the scenes in&nbsp;which the character had to&nbsp;sing. In&nbsp;<a href=#>2015</a>, Jennifer paid tribute to&nbsp;the “<a href=#>Queen of&nbsp;Tejano music</a>” at&nbsp;an&nbsp;awards ceremony, this time with her own voice.</p><p><h2>10. BD&nbsp;Wong in&nbsp;Mulan (1998)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e9/c13/40b5a35fb5a0599e17ba2ec2dd.jpg><p>The <a href=#>actor</a> performed the original dubbing for the character of&nbsp;<a href=#>Captain Li&nbsp;Shang</a>, except for the singing of&nbsp;<a href=#>I’ll Make A&nbsp;Man Out Of&nbsp;You</a>. <a href=#>Donny Osmond</a> was <a href=#>chosen</a> by&nbsp;Disney to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the animated film because the voices of&nbsp;both were similar, and they offered him the responsibility of&nbsp;interpreting the song. 20&nbsp;years after its release, the singer <a href=#>recalled</a> his moment of&nbsp;glory and commented that he&nbsp;punched his stomach, as&nbsp;did the character, at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the recording to&nbsp;make the shot more realistic.</p><p><h2>11. George Clooney in&nbsp;O&nbsp;Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d59/438/35e43f5b15902b6c8cbb3aafae.jpg><p>The <a href=#>actor</a> was ready to&nbsp;sing <a href=#>I&nbsp;Am a&nbsp;Man of&nbsp;Constant Sorrow</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;recording studio, in&nbsp;preparation for the film. However, it&nbsp;seems that the results were not as&nbsp;expected by&nbsp;directors, or&nbsp;so&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href=#>remembered</a> from his perspective. In&nbsp;light of&nbsp;this situation, singer <a href=#>Dan Tyminski</a> was hired to&nbsp;interpret the song, and Clooney was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;moving his lips to&nbsp;the beat of&nbsp;the lyrics. The musician <a href=#>expressed</a> his amazement when this soundtrack became a&nbsp;hit on&nbsp;and off the film.</p><p><h2>12. Zac Efron in&nbsp;High School Musical (2006)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ab/d1b/fec8605ae5b0676e45942b423c.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you thought <a href=#>Zac Efron</a> was the one who sang all the songs in&nbsp;this trilogy as&nbsp;<a href=#>Troy Bolton</a>, you’d have to&nbsp;remove the first movie from that list. Even though he&nbsp;made his own musical recordings, he&nbsp;realized that his voice was not <a href=#>included</a> and he&nbsp;received no&nbsp;explanation from the editors. <a href=#>Drew Seeley</a> was the one who really gave the character his voice when he&nbsp;sang, but that wasn’t his only collaboration. He&nbsp;later replaced Efron on&nbsp;the cast’s post-release concert <a href=#>tour</a>.</p><p><h2>13. Marion Cotillard in&nbsp;La&nbsp;Vie en&nbsp;Rose (2007)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/743/22a/8f221d58e4875176230058ebb4.jpg><p><a href=#>Marion</a> received several awards thanks to&nbsp;this film which deals with <a href=#>Édith Piaf’</a>s life. The producers made the <a href=#>decision</a> that her voice was not required to&nbsp;sing and that the actual recordings of&nbsp;the famous French singer were used. The actress confessed that she <a href=#>took</a> singing lessons anyway to&nbsp;perfect her lip-synching, tongue posture, and breathing, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get as&nbsp;close as&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;what Piaf did in&nbsp;real life.</p><p><h2>14. Yaya DaCosta in&nbsp;Whitney (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e52/ee0/d4bf16511c941b01d748d7fc47.jpg><p><a href=#>Yaya</a> was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;bringing singer <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a> to&nbsp;life in&nbsp;the biographical television film, but in&nbsp;the singing scenes, she received help from someone else. <a href=#>Angela Bassett</a>, the director of&nbsp;this production, invited singer <a href=#>Deborah Cox</a> to&nbsp;<a href=#>re-record</a> Whitney’s most famous songs in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;the tone of&nbsp;the real artist’s voice. However, the actress was <a href=#>allowed</a> to&nbsp;sing, to&nbsp;the delight of&nbsp;the extras involved in&nbsp;the shooting.</p><p><h2>15. Rebecca Ferguson in&nbsp;The Greatest Showman (2017)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25c/b20/6db42d55269e7c4d706e64e739.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most remembered songs in&nbsp;this musical film has been <a href=#>Never Enough</a>, which was sung by&nbsp;<a href=#>Jenny Lind</a>. However, Ferguson only interpreted it&nbsp;physically. The actress herself <a href=#>acknowledged</a> that “singing” was the most intimidating part of&nbsp;her filming process. The one who really sang this tune was <a href=#>Loren Allred</a>, who <a href=#>bragged</a> on&nbsp;Instagram about her participation as&nbsp;the singing voice of&nbsp;this story.</p><p><h2>16. Rami Malek in&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f28/318/9f8ca95be4ac67cec4f39d539f.jpg><p>Despite being awarded an&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar</a> for Best Actor for his starring role in&nbsp;this film, <a href=#>Malek</a> was unable to&nbsp;replicate the vocal qualities of&nbsp;the real <a href=#>Freddie Mercury</a>. According to&nbsp;his producer, <a href=#>Graham King</a>, the <a href=#>solution</a> was to&nbsp;combine old recordings of&nbsp;Mercury with new ones made by&nbsp;<a href=#>Marc Martel</a>, a&nbsp;Canadian rock singer whose <a href=#>voice</a> is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;the British musician.</p><p><h2>17. Rachel McAdams in&nbsp;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of&nbsp;Fire Saga (2020)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d32/9b7/486a16584fa9bda95e1a8791d6.jpg><p>The <a href=#>actress</a> starred in&nbsp;this <a href=#>film</a> and played Sigrit Ericksdóttir, a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Icelandic duo that aspires to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;musical competition held in&nbsp;Europe. Although Rachel initially <a href=#>sang</a> for her scenes, the production crew decided to&nbsp;merge her voice with that of&nbsp;<a href=#>Molly Sandén</a>, a&nbsp;Swedish singer who participated in&nbsp;the children’s version of&nbsp;the real Eurovision Song Contest.

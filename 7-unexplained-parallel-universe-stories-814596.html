<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It&nbsp;was July 1954, a&nbsp;scorching hot day: a&nbsp;man arrived at&nbsp;Haneda Airport in&nbsp;Tokyo, <a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a>. He&nbsp;had recently landed from a&nbsp;plane flying over from <a href=# title=Europe data-link=tag>Europe</a>. There was nothing unusual about him at&nbsp;first glance: he&nbsp;was elegantly dressed, with no&nbsp;distinguishing features.</p><p>He&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;simple man sporting a&nbsp;beard. He&nbsp;made his way to&nbsp;customs, just as&nbsp;all the other people surrounding him. The customs officer picked up&nbsp;this man’s <a href=# title=passport data-link=tag>passport</a>. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;browse through its pages, the officer immediately noticed something was wrong.</p><p>The traveler reassured him: “Oh, I&nbsp;come from a&nbsp;faraway country, but this is&nbsp;my&nbsp;third time visiting Japan!” What was it&nbsp;with that man’s passport that was so&nbsp;unusual, that they thought he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fraud? Or&nbsp;a&nbsp;spy? Or, most intriguing of&nbsp;them all, a&nbsp;time traveler?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/176/322/577a44518c8a344459d35d2525.png><p>The man’s passport did look authentic. The problem was it&nbsp;claimed he&nbsp;came from a&nbsp;country no&nbsp;one had ever <a href=# title=heard data-link=tag>heard</a>&nbsp;of: Taured. So, he&nbsp;was immediately taken for interrogation. The traveler then tried to&nbsp;convince the Japanese authorities that his country was real. He&nbsp;even pointed to&nbsp;its location on&nbsp;the map: a&nbsp;small territory located between Spain and France. Since his primary language was French, it&nbsp;did make sense.</p><p>However, the area he&nbsp;pointed out on&nbsp;the map was actually the Principality of&nbsp;Andorra&nbsp;— a&nbsp;microstate located between France and Spain of&nbsp;only 180&nbsp;sq miles. When seeing the map himself, the traveler was also puzzled that his country was called Andorra. He&nbsp;claimed Taured had been there for over 1000&nbsp;years.</p><p>Customs officers saw he&nbsp;also had money from several different European countries on&nbsp;him. His passport also had stamps from many airports around the world, including previous visits to&nbsp;Tokyo. Obviously, the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and decided he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken into custody overnight for further investigation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2c0/569/84d7bd5b7da5f4501c3149bb66.png><p>Officers initially tried to&nbsp;contact the company he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was working for. He&nbsp;even had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;company documents on&nbsp;him to&nbsp;prove his point. But to&nbsp;their surprise, none of&nbsp;the people from that company had ever heard of&nbsp;him! They then tried to&nbsp;contact the <a href=# title=hotel data-link=tag>hotel</a> he&nbsp;claimed he&nbsp;had reservations&nbsp;in. You guessed&nbsp;it, they hadn’t heard of&nbsp;him either. The bank that issued his checks? Didn’t exist.</p><p>The traveler was set up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;nearby hotel and to&nbsp;ensure he&nbsp;would not get away, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when entering his room, officers were astonished to&nbsp;see he’d simply vanished! The local police established that he&nbsp;couldn’t have escaped out of&nbsp;the window. His room was several floors&nbsp;up, and there was no&nbsp;balcony either.</p><p>Initially, Japanese officials were confident they would still be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find him quickly and solve the mystery. They had confiscated his paperwork the day before. But, to&nbsp;their shock, all his personal belongings, including the documents mentioning his mysterious country of&nbsp;Taured, had vanished too and were nowhere to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen. Some thought he&nbsp;must have been some sort of&nbsp;government secret agent.</p><p>His documents looked authentic, so&nbsp;they must have been forged by&nbsp;professionals. To&nbsp;protect his identity and that of&nbsp;his country of&nbsp;origin, his superiors probably came up&nbsp;with this imaginary country of&nbsp;Taured. They hoped airport officials would simply look at&nbsp;the papers without raising any concerns. His mysterious disappearance was also explained by&nbsp;some high-tech extraction operation, performed by&nbsp;an&nbsp;intelligence service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e81/ab5/f80b5f5b1591b7c9d76a81f90e.png><p>Others thought the man from Taured must have been from another dimension. Voilà, the multiverse exists! They claimed that the country of&nbsp;Taured probably existed in&nbsp;his version of&nbsp;the universe since he&nbsp;did say it&nbsp;was founded over 1,000 years ago. Andorra was just our version of&nbsp;that specific territory. When he&nbsp;figured out he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;trouble, he&nbsp;simply passed into his original dimension. How did he&nbsp;manage to&nbsp;get back his documents too, that’s still up&nbsp;for debate.</p><p>He&nbsp;was even thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;time traveler, coming all the way from a&nbsp;future where the Principality of&nbsp;Andorra somehow becomes Taured. The simplest explanation of&nbsp;them all is&nbsp;that probably this was all made&nbsp;up. Or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least blown out of&nbsp;proportion. The source of&nbsp;this urban legend was eventually figured out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;man named John Zegrus&nbsp;— An&nbsp;American-born man who traveled the world using a&nbsp;fake passport of&nbsp;a&nbsp;country he&nbsp;simply invented.</p><p>This may sound a&nbsp;bit unbelievable these days when we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fully digital age, but back then people using fake passports were quite a&nbsp;common thing. You just needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sufficiently confident&nbsp;— and dressed for the job&nbsp;— to&nbsp;pass off as&nbsp;someone VIP. Even from a&nbsp;made-up country! Remember when he&nbsp;claimed he&nbsp;had visited Japan before? He&nbsp;didn’t lie!</p><p>John did apply for a&nbsp;Japanese visa under a&nbsp;Taured passport, and it&nbsp;got approved! After that, he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;problems entering Japan. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;know today that this man traveled the world with fake documents and IDs and was involved in&nbsp;financial scams. On&nbsp;10 August 1960, a&nbsp;Japanese Court sentenced Zegrus to&nbsp;one year in&nbsp;prison. He&nbsp;was then released and deported from Japan to&nbsp;Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/24d/f79/ff71b85aa1b0c32d5b32d6339b.png><p>John Zegrus wasn’t the only urban time travel legend. One video that surfaced in&nbsp;2006 showed a&nbsp;Swedish man claiming that he&nbsp;had accidentally traveled to&nbsp;2046&nbsp;as he&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;fix his kitchen sink. While in&nbsp;the future, he&nbsp;stumbled upon someone who claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his 70&nbsp;years old self!</p><p>They had a&nbsp;great time together and even filmed short footage. In&nbsp;it, they showed a&nbsp;tattoo they shared to&nbsp;prove they were the same person! Sadly, the story was nothing more than a&nbsp;marketing campaign to&nbsp;promote pension plans.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;1995, a&nbsp;man named Mike Marcum tried to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;time machine in&nbsp;his house in&nbsp;Stanberry, Missouri. He&nbsp;named this project the Jacobs Ladder. It’s said he&nbsp;vanished in&nbsp;1997 and hasn’t been seen ever since. There’s still no&nbsp;explanation for his disappearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/097/f35/8e99035acaa59ea2cf013b10dc.png><p>Then there’s the story of&nbsp;the 1860 painting by&nbsp;Austrian artist Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller. Called “The Expected One” it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;depict a&nbsp;woman holding and looking down at&nbsp;an&nbsp;iPhone! On&nbsp;a&nbsp;closer look, art experts revealed that the alleged iPhone in&nbsp;the painting was just a&nbsp;book, painted from a&nbsp;very misleading angle.</p><p>The story of&nbsp;Rudolph Fentz is&nbsp;another one of&nbsp;those urban legends that goes back to&nbsp;the 1950s. It&nbsp;claims that in&nbsp;1951, in&nbsp;New York City a&nbsp;man dressed in&nbsp;19th-century clothes was hit by&nbsp;a&nbsp;car. He&nbsp;was identified as&nbsp;Rudolph Fentz, but the problem was, that he&nbsp;was reported to&nbsp;be&nbsp;missing since 1876!</p><p>The items he&nbsp;was carrying also suggested he&nbsp;jumped from 1876 to&nbsp;1951&nbsp;directly. Sadly, for this one too, these events never actually happened in&nbsp;real life. They just originated from a&nbsp;science fiction book of&nbsp;the 1950s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5dc/652/0c9c225c72bb97c2d75fd855e8.png><p>A&nbsp;genuine photograph from 1941 of&nbsp;the re-opening of&nbsp;the South Fork Bridge in&nbsp;Gold Bridge, British Columbia also sparked some debate. It&nbsp;appeared to&nbsp;show a&nbsp;time traveler. That was because his clothing and sunglasses were not of&nbsp;the time. They looked more like what a&nbsp;young man might wear these days. Further research showed that it&nbsp;wasn’t the case though.</p><p>Let’s take his sunglasses as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example: their style first appeared in&nbsp;the 1920s. Then, he&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;printed T-shirt. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;look closely though, we&nbsp;can notice he’s actually sporting a&nbsp;sweater with a&nbsp;sewn-on emblem. These kinds of&nbsp;garments were actually in&nbsp;style at&nbsp;the time. The remainder of&nbsp;his clothing is&nbsp;appropriate for his time. His clothes are a&nbsp;bit more casual than those worn by&nbsp;the people around him in&nbsp;the photograph, which does make him stand out a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>Another 1940s photo sparked intrigue online as&nbsp;it&nbsp;appeared to&nbsp;show a&nbsp;man holding an&nbsp;iPhone! The picture, taken on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach, shows a&nbsp;man&nbsp;— dressed in&nbsp;time-appropriate clothing walking through the crowd and looking at&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;device in&nbsp;his hands. People were fast to&nbsp;assume time travel was the only possible explanation, but that’s not the case. He&nbsp;was most likely looking down at&nbsp;another object, but it’s difficult to&nbsp;see because of&nbsp;the quality of&nbsp;the picture.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIRuwc2er6mkkZ67prCMqZirmZyhsq151Kegr52iqLJuv9OoqaKdo2KFcoCUcm1o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f7-unexplained-parallel-universe-stories-814596.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f7-unexplained-parallel-universe-stories-814596.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f7-unexplained-parallel-universe-stories-814596.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f7-unexplained-parallel-universe-stories-814596.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f7-unexplained-parallel-universe-stories-814596.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f7-unexplained-parallel-universe-stories-814596.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./complex-emotions-german.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./complex-emotions-german.html>8 German words for complex emotions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./7-signs-your-personality-might-be-intimidating-to-others-795238.html>7 Signs Your Personality Might Be Intimidating to Others</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./7-signs-your-personality-might-be-intimidating-to-others-795238.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

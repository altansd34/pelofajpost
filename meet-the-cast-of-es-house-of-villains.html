Entertainment</span><p class=reading-time>Reading Time: 5 minutes</p><p><strong>E! has officially brought a brand new show into the reality universe. For the new series, House of Villains, E! has brought together 10 of the most well-known reality television villains, under one roof. The series, hosted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel McHale</a>, airs with a 75 minute episode on Thursday, Oct. 12 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on E!, Bravo, SYFY and USA.</strong></p><p>House of Villains brings together some of the most popular reality television franchises. The “villains” are set to meet their match as they’re tasked to outsmart, out-manipulate and out-scheme one another. They will compete in a set of challenges in order to win $200,000 cash and the title of “America’s Ultimate Supervillain.”</p><p>Throughout the competition, “villains” will compete in battle-royale style challenges that test their physical, mental, and emotional strength. Challenge winners are safe from elimination, and one person will be voted out each week. These reality show personalities are known for scheming their way to the top of other shows, so it should be interesting to see them meet their matches. In addition to this season’s “villains” fans should look forward to seeing guest stars, Carole Baskin, Abby Lee Miller, Spencer Pratt, Chef Ben Robinson and Danielle Staub.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-the-cast-of-e-s-house-of-villains>Meet The Cast of E!’s House of Villains</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-anfisa-arkhipchenko>1. Anfisa Arkhipchenko</h3><p>Anfisa rose to prominence as part of the series, 90 Day Fiancé. In 2016, her journey with eventual husband Jorge Nava, was documented. The pair met on Facebook, and eventually had a rocky, yet well documented relationship. Her actions toward Nava were what earned her villain status. She was notoriously disabling his phones, hitting him, keying his car, and kicking him out of his own apartment. Anfisa and Nava divorced in 2020.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-johnny-bananas>2.

Shake Chatterjee</h2><p>If you watched the 2022 season of Love Is Blind, you’ll remember Shake. He earned his villain status on Love Is Blind when he made remarks about his fiancé Deepti Vempati behind her back. While speaking to another cast member, Shake admitted “I’m not physically attracted to her, man. It feels like I’m with my aunt or something.”</p><p>Although Shake spoke about said comments during the show’s reunion and beyond, his villain status is still there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-jonny-fairplay>4. Jonny Fairplay</h2><p>In 2003, Johnny Fairplay rose to prominence during Survivor: Pearl Islands, during the show’s seventh season. During filming, Johnny pretended that his grandmother died. Due to the lie, Johnny placed third in the series, and his villain status was validated. Johnny’s lie was so big that the show’s host, Jeff Probst called it “The greatest lie in Survivor history.”</p><p>Later, Johnny went on to appear in Survivor: Micronesia – Fans vs Favorite, where he had extremely public feuds with other cast members. Aside from Survivor, this villain is in the world of professional wrestling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-bobby-lytes>5. Bobby Lytes</h2><p>Reality tv fans were introduced with Bobby Lytes on VH1’s Love & Hip-Hop Miami’s fourth season launched in 2018. Bobby was the first openly gay cast member in the franchise, and earned his place as a villain due to friendship’s fizzling out, a messy break up, and ruthless arguments. Since then, Bobby has been very active on social media making comments about his crush on Lil Nas X.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-corinne-olympios>6. Corinne Olympios</h2><p>Corinne Olympios rose to prominence during Season 21 of The Bachelor in 2017. During Nick Viall’s season, Corinne is remembered for her sexually aggressive approach toward The Bachelor. This included going topless during a bridal-themed photo shoot on a group date, mentioning having a “platinum vagina” and even instructing the bachelor to “grab my boobs” while in the pool with other castmates.</p><p>Although Viall was often clearly uncomfortable, Corinne made it to hometown dates and finished fourth in the season. She further validated her villain status after stirring up drama on Bachelor in Paradise. On that series, she insinuated that she was a victim of sexual crime, then later corrected herself and apologized.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-omarosa>7.

In 2008, she appeared on Celebrity Apprentice, then All-Star Celebrity Apprentice in 2013.</p><p>Reportedly, Omarosa kept ties with the former President, and even reunited with him for her own dating show, The Ultimate Merger. She once again worked as an aide for Trump in 2016.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-tiffany-new-york-pollard>8. Tiffany “New York” Pollard</h2><p>Tiffany “New York” Pollard rose to prominence in the first two seasons of VH1’s Flavor of Love (2006-2007). In the series, she competed for the heart of rapper Flavor Flav, but finished as runner up both times. Tiffany became known for her rifts with other castmates, and ultimately referred to herself as “HBIC” or “head b*tch in charge.” She earned her validity as a villain for her nickname, eye rolls, smirks, and other facial reactions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-jax-taylor>9.

Tanisha Thomas</h2><p>Tanisha Thomas rose to prominence on Bad Girls Club, since she pulled a lot of hair and threw some punches during fights with other women. Her villainous ways even helped her “create” the term “pop off,” which some credit her for.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_TheVoiceSeason23_Coaches_Greg-Gayne_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Should ‘The Voice’ Coaches Have a Limit on Four-Chair Turns?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>House of Villains</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJur8Csq2anlmKytHnHqKysnV2ks27CyKWjmqGeqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-the-cast-of-es-house-of-villains.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-the-cast-of-es-house-of-villains.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-the-cast-of-es-house-of-villains.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-the-cast-of-es-house-of-villains.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-the-cast-of-es-house-of-villains.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-the-cast-of-es-house-of-villains.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./761998-must-read-13-things-women-keep-husbands-men-love-no-7-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./761998-must-read-13-things-women-keep-husbands-men-love-no-7-html.html>MUST READ: Things women do to keep their husbands</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maks-chmerkovskiy-reveals-the-real-reason-he-will-never-return-to-dancing-with-the-stars.html>Maks Chmerkovskiy Reveals The Real Reason He Will Never Return to 'Dancing With The Stars'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maks-chmerkovskiy-reveals-the-real-reason-he-will-never-return-to-dancing-with-the-stars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

<time>31 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>We’re in&nbsp;<a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a>, in&nbsp;the village of&nbsp;Turville. It’s 1871. Here, on&nbsp;one street, you can find a&nbsp;particular house. It’s no&nbsp;different from the others, but many people stay around it&nbsp;and wait for something.</p><p>The house’s doors open. Several adults come out of&nbsp;there. They look surprised and say that all the rumors turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/48d/c81/bcd83b538997aca9bd77dd48b9.png><p>The woman goes out on&nbsp;the porch and asks a&nbsp;few more people to&nbsp;come&nbsp;in. And you’re among them. You go&nbsp;inside, head into the room, and see an&nbsp;11-year-old girl sleeping on&nbsp;the bed. She looks pale and thin. Despite loud people’s conversations in&nbsp;the room, the girl doesn’t wake&nbsp;up. Her mother says it’s been 6&nbsp;months since she fell asleep. You leave the room, and the next few people come in&nbsp;to&nbsp;see the sleeping girl with their own eyes.</p><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;story about the most prolonged sleep in&nbsp;history. The record belongs to&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl named Ellen Sadler, who slept for 9&nbsp;years. She was born in&nbsp;the English village of&nbsp;Turville in&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;the 19th century in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big family. Ellen was the 12th kid. Her parents weren’t wealthy and worked hard to&nbsp;make ends meet.</p><p>They taught their sons and daughters to&nbsp;help them from an&nbsp;early age. And Ellen was no&nbsp;exception. When she turned&nbsp;11, she left home to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nanny in&nbsp;a&nbsp;nearby town. While away from her family and surrounded by&nbsp;strangers, Ellen began to&nbsp;feel bad. She had a&nbsp;headache, felt discomfort, and felt certain drowsiness. These symptoms became so&nbsp;severe that the girl couldn’t work properly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/139/a95/c40fdd501f8716ab194c054e51.png><p>She returned to&nbsp;the house in&nbsp;the village where her parents sent her to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. The doctors didn’t know how to&nbsp;help her because they couldn’t diagnose her. They spent 18&nbsp;weeks trying to&nbsp;cure the poor girl. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, still unwell, Ellen was discharged from the hospital.</p><p>After returning home, she experienced severe headaches and drowsiness. Ellen Sadler felt worse and worse. And then, one day, she quietly lay down in&nbsp;her bed and fell asleep. Ellen woke up&nbsp;only after 9&nbsp;years. All this time, the girl’s mother took care of&nbsp;her.</p><p>She fed her milk and tea. The sleeping girl was losing weight and strength. Soon, the whole village found out about Ellen. People started coming to&nbsp;her house to&nbsp;see an&nbsp;unusual phenomenon. They looked at&nbsp;her, tried to&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up, and told their friends about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c66/67f/7adba758fca18774167c9b0130.png><p>The news about the sleeping girl spread throughout the country. Ellen had become a&nbsp;spectacle. People from all over England came to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;person who had been sleeping for several years. They called the house where the Ellen family lived “Sleepy Cottage.”</p><p>Doctors and reporters came there. One journalist from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> described that the girl’s body was weak and too soft. Her feet were icy cold, and her lips were blue. The child’s breathing was barely discernible. It&nbsp;seemed that life was slowly leaving this body.</p><p>The girl’s family took donations for the care of&nbsp;her daughter. Therefore, many people thought that it&nbsp;was all a&nbsp;performance. For some reason, the mother didn’t allow the doctor to&nbsp;stay with Ellen for a&nbsp;long time. Some said that her mother gave her sleeping pills every day to&nbsp;not let her wake&nbsp;up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d26/0f6/56bf1c51a49189b5832d55721a.png><p>And someone claimed that they had seen a&nbsp;conscious girl sitting by&nbsp;the window. Also, the girl’s mother rejected the doctors’ offer to&nbsp;conduct a&nbsp;medical examination in&nbsp;a&nbsp;London hospital. We’re unlikely to&nbsp;find out the whole truth about her since there was no&nbsp;official diagnosis from doctors.</p><p>It’s possible the girl fell into a&nbsp;coma or&nbsp;suffered from another disease that was unknown to&nbsp;science in&nbsp;the 19th century. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;chronic sleep disorder in&nbsp;which a&nbsp;person experiences uncontrollable bouts of&nbsp;drowsiness. You can walk down the street and want to&nbsp;sleep so&nbsp;much that you fall to&nbsp;the ground. Ellen grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;large family and got used to&nbsp;hard work early. Perhaps, severe fatigue and lack of&nbsp;sleep provoked narcolepsy.</p><p>In&nbsp;any case, this story had a&nbsp;good ending. One day Ellen Sadler woke&nbsp;up. She didn’t remember what had happened and was very surprised when her family told her about the 9-year-long dream. The girl’s growth slowed down a&nbsp;little, and her eyesight worsened, but her health wasn’t bad. Ellen got married and had six children. In&nbsp;1911, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;about&nbsp;50, she passed away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e20/c3f/77b8695b8ea8db37e00f85b21a.png><p>Let’s see a&nbsp;completely opposite story about a&nbsp;person who set a&nbsp;record for the longest time without sleep. In&nbsp;January 1964, 17-year-old Randy Gardner, a&nbsp;high school student, claimed he&nbsp;stayed awake for several weeks. The experiment started in&nbsp;December and ended in&nbsp;January. And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;that time, he&nbsp;felt pretty normal.</p><p>This event was in&nbsp;the Guinness Book of&nbsp;Records and allowed scientists to&nbsp;learn a&nbsp;lot about the structure of&nbsp;the human brain. Randy wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;science school project related to&nbsp;sleep. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;stay awake as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;possible, and his friend had to&nbsp;make sure that he&nbsp;was always awake.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, everything went well. Randy’s friend kept a&nbsp;diary where he&nbsp;recorded the slightest changes in&nbsp;the subject’s body. Randy held on&nbsp;easily for the first 2&nbsp;days. He&nbsp;was constantly on&nbsp;his feet and didn’t come to&nbsp;bed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1fd/a9c/87ec4d5e18a4e4a0decbb387a7.png><p>After three days, his cognitive and sensory abilities began to&nbsp;decline. On&nbsp;the fourth day, Randy felt sick. He&nbsp;walked around the house and sniffed citrus fruits. The smell of&nbsp;lemons and oranges helped him get rid of&nbsp;this bad condition.</p><p>During the day, Randy played <a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a> and went bowling with friends. The nights were boring because the guys didn’t know what to&nbsp;do. But still, Randy didn’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed.</p><p>A&nbsp;week passed, and Randy showed excellent basketball results. His physical skills hadn’t changed. His speech was clear and logical. By&nbsp;this moment, the news all over the country had been speaking about Randy and his experiment. He&nbsp;became a&nbsp;celebrity. And it&nbsp;also helped him stay awake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a16/873/1293035417a7b206c8ef94dd27.png><p>Scientists came to&nbsp;Randy. With the help of&nbsp;mathematical questions, they tested his intellectual abilities. And here, he&nbsp;showed poor results. He&nbsp;was solving an&nbsp;example in&nbsp;mathematics, but then he&nbsp;forgot what was going on&nbsp;and what he&nbsp;was doing.</p><p>Scientists scanned his brain and recorded its activity data. Then, on&nbsp;January&nbsp;8, 1964, at&nbsp;2&nbsp;a.m., Randy broke the previous record time without sleep. He&nbsp;was awake for 264&nbsp;hours. Scientists attached electrodes to&nbsp;his head when he&nbsp;fell asleep and observed brain activity.</p><p>Randy woke up&nbsp;after a&nbsp;few hours of&nbsp;sleep to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the toilet. Then, he&nbsp;lay in&nbsp;bed again and got up&nbsp;only after 14&nbsp;hours. He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;school in&nbsp;a&nbsp;great mood. Everyone was shocked. It&nbsp;seemed that this brain-heavy experiment had no&nbsp;negative consequences. Randy continued to&nbsp;study as&nbsp;before, play basketball, and spend time with friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/296/eba/a26bbc5d0f835c1ea53d35214d.png><p>Scientists studied brain research results and found that Randy’s brain was catching a&nbsp;light sleep all this time. These are called “micro sleeps” and the curious thing is&nbsp;that the person who’s experiencing it&nbsp;may not even notice that they’re technically sleeping.</p><p>Several years passed. Everyone already forgot about this record. Randy grew&nbsp;up. One day, a&nbsp;reporter remembered Randy’s experiment and interviewed him. He&nbsp;admitted that the experiment hadn’t passed without a&nbsp;trace.</p><p>For many years, Randy experienced severe insomnia. It&nbsp;was driving him crazy. He&nbsp;spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time and effort to&nbsp;overcome this disease. Fortunately, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;adjust his sleep regime. Randy slept 6&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day, which was quite enough.</p><p>Repeating this experiment is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad idea. Even two days without sleep are a&nbsp;great stress for the body. For thousands of&nbsp;years, people have survived hunger and complex work conditions. Our heart is&nbsp;trained to&nbsp;experience high loads, and our body can survive difficult situations. But our body has never encountered a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;the entire history of&nbsp;humanity. Evolution has not taught&nbsp;us to&nbsp;endure sleepless nights without consequences, which is&nbsp;why it’s bad for our health.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5us8iro2avmKR6tLjEqatmnp%2Bnenp52J6Yq6tdlrulec2omaicqWK4r7HWZq6hsV1tfnSFmHFm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-girl-who-slept-for-9-years-and-nobody-knew-why-813998.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-girl-who-slept-for-9-years-and-nobody-knew-why-813998.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-girl-who-slept-for-9-years-and-nobody-knew-why-813998.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-girl-who-slept-for-9-years-and-nobody-knew-why-813998.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-girl-who-slept-for-9-years-and-nobody-knew-why-813998.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-girl-who-slept-for-9-years-and-nobody-knew-why-813998.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./9691-northern-powerhouse-does-it-make-sense.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./9691-northern-powerhouse-does-it-make-sense.html>A Northern Powerhouse: Does It Make Sense?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./9-gorgeous-dresses-from-amazon-that-will-help-you-replicate-celebrity-looks-811671.html>9 Gorgeous Dresses From Amazon That Will Help You Replicate Celebrity Looks</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./9-gorgeous-dresses-from-amazon-that-will-help-you-replicate-celebrity-looks-811671.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

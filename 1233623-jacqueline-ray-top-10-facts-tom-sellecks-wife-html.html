Selleck was married to model Jacqueline Ray for 11 years, starting May 1971. The two are said to have met on set for the TV show <i>Magnum PI</i> that Selleck acted and directed. After their marriage, the renowned actor adopted Jacqueline Ray's son, Kevin.</p><p class=align-left>Tom and Jacqueline's marriage ended after 11 years. Why did Tom Selleck divorce his first wife? Jacqueline is said to have been jealous of all the attention her husband was getting after his massively successful role in <i>Magnum PI.</i></p><p class=align-left>Other reports suggest that Tom moved to Hawaii to film a movie, a decision that led to the divorce. In 1992, <a href=#>the actress</a> married Clarence Barry Witmer, and the two had a daughter named Umeko Ray. The actress' third marriage was short-lived.</p><h4>Jacqueline Ray's son, Kevin Selleck</h4><p class=align-left>Kevin Selleck followed in his stepfather's footsteps and became an actor. He is best known for his role in the 1997 film <i>Scream 2</i>. Before venturing into acting, Kevin was part of a five-person rock band that even had an album release in 1996.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3d9fb726ea9e78f4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hannah Kepple’s biography: what is known about the Cobra Kai star?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The band broke up after a while, and Kevin decided to pursue a solo career in <a href=#>music</a>. However, this did not work out, prompting him to reunite with his former band members. Unfortunately, the band was not nearly as successful this time around as it was the first time.</p><p class=align-left>After his stint in the music industry, he became an actor, largely with the help of his stepfather, Tom Selleck. His first acting role was in <i>Magnum PI</i>, alongside his mother and stepdad.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike his stepdad, Kevin keeps a low profile and rarely appears in the public eye. He is married to Annabelle, and the two have six children together.</p><h3>Tom Selleck's first wife's photo</h3><p class=align-left>Here is an old pic of Jacqueline alongside some of her friends.</p><h3>Murder charges</h3><p class=align-left>In 2014, Jacqueline was charged with second-degree murder. The backstory to Jacqueline's crime has a lot to do with her daughter. Umeko Ray got married in 2008 to a man named Leon Bauchum. A few years into their marriage, Jacqueline learned that Leon was abusing Umeko both physically and emotionally.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/777a96f4f17eaf8d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jacqueline Ray's biography: who is Tom Selleck's first wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As a result, the actress decided to take matters into her own hands and hired an assassin to kill Leon. The hired hitman was known as Luis Barker. Details from the murder charges show that Ray paid the hitman a significant amount of money to carry out the assassination.</p><h3>Imprisonment</h3><p class=align-left>After the court hearing, the actress was found guilty of second-degree murder and slapped with an 18-year prison sentence. During her sentencing, Ray claimed that her primary motive for killing Leon was to protect her daughter and grandchildren.</p><p class=align-left>Additional details about the crime also emerged during the hearings. The prosecution claimed that the actress lured her son in law into her house, where Luis lay in wait. The hitman then shot Leon and dumped his body in a ditch in Washington.</p><h3>Where is Jacqueline Ray today?</h3><p class=align-left>Despite numerous pleas from Ray's daughter and her reverend, the judge did not agree to a lenient penalty and sentenced <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1433913-jasmine-davis-biography-imani-chi.html href=#>the actress</a> to 18 years behind bars.

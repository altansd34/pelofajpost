However, over time, he established himselfas a main street rapper who wrote and produced lyrics with <a id=https://legit.ng/1406472-50-beautiful-names-light-give-child.html href=#>deep meaning</a>. Here are some of Mac Miller's songs' quotes that will give you an in-depth view of his music:</p><ul><li>You can expect the unexpected / These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but / I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings.</li><li>Hey, blow out the candles, make a wish / What's a life if you never take a risk?</li><li>My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther / When I'm sleepwalking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker.</li><li>Take me to euphoria according to the story of a warrior / Picturing my visions as you look inside my cornea.</li><li>If you wanna stay, we’re taking it slow baby / Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring Prince quotes and lyrics about love, life and music</span></p></a><h3>Mac Miller's captions for social media</h3><p class=align-left>Although he is well known for his deep lyrics, Miller collaborated with different artists such as Chance the Rapper, Jaden Smith, Kehlani, and Ariana Grande. Some of his lyrics contain perfect quotes for social media cations. They include:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0c3fea140237a576.jpg><p class=align-left>Here are some of Mac Miller's love quotes, views about the <a href=#>world</a> and general <a href=#>thoughts about life</a>:</p><ul><li>They told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favour. You’re way too young, and right now that’s just human nature.</li><li>To me, women have always been the sturdiest people in my life and have been incredible sources of energy.</li><li>When you feel sad, it's okay. It's not the end of the world. Everyone has those days when you doubt yourself, and when you feel like everything you do is not worth it, but then there's those days when you feel like Superman. It's just the balance of the world. I just write to feel better.</li><li>I don't know if I'm a feminist, but I just know that I am all for outspoken, powerful women.</li><li>Fear, to me, is a guiding thing more than anything.</li><li>Sunshine or rain, I'll be there. Whether good times or bad, I'll be there</li><li>Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are, and baby that's my favourite part.</li><li>Being famous used to just defeat me. I wouldn't leave my house because I was worried about someone being like, 'Oh, are you Mac Miller?' and then the rest of the night I couldn't be myself.</li><li>Time goes by living without you, hope you know, I’ve been thinking about you.</li><li>My ideology was, if I just make very happy music, very happy music, then people will forget about whatever their problems are. I will forget about my problems</li><li>Don’t count the number of friends you have, but the number of friends you can count on.</li><li>I used to just think about what my fans wanted all the time. But it just started feeling weird to me. I want to just show everyone who I am and stick to my vision. I have to trust myself.</li><li>In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family. If it wasn’t for them, I’d be way closer to insanity.</li><li>We fear rejection, want attention, crave affection, and dream of perfection</li><li>I flood the Internet with what I think is quality content. That's why I did things like giving out a song every 100,000 Twitter followers because I am just looking for ways to get my fans to hear all this music without oversaturating things.</li><li>Every single person in my life and every relationship I have is distant because all I do is music.</li><li>I've always wanted to sing. I don't think I have a great voice, but I just think that I get the emotion. It's very authentic. Whatever emotion I'm feeling, I can sing it, and you can feel it.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c5c960e5e8e6deb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dwight Schrute: Most hilarious quotes and memes from your favourite character</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b6aabc22e6e129e4.jpg><ul><li>People love you when they on your mind. A thought is love’s currency.</li><li>I can have a song with Ariana Grande that is going to be the song for all the kids and the teen girls, and then another song that could be for a different group of people who all love the song. Im with whoever. Whatever type of people want to love the music and whatever they love about the music is fine with me.</li><li>I just like to sing for people who have lost love.</li><li>I just have always felt as long as I'm 100 percent honest, then it's just me. It's a lot easier to sleep at night that way</li><li>There’s a lot of beauty in the world, so go hang out and go be a part of the solution rather than the problem.</li><li>Stand by those who stand by you.</li></ul><h3>Mac Miller quotes about death</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f0f8e1d7bf9b24d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing Harley Quinn quotes from the iconic DC character</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His passing not only provoked the need to have a conversation about mental health but also brought about the need to have a conversation about people recovering from addiction.

Mentor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Stamos</a> warned him not to change up the arrangement too much so that the song was still recognizable. But Arthur did what he does best and created a brand new arrangement. He is masterful, a guitar whiz, and pretty much everything that the next American Idol should be. So why are fans calling his return to the competition so unfair?</p><p>After live voting took place throughout the episode, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three contestants were eliminated</a>. Six names were called and Arthur was left standing on the stage with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cassandra Coleman</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deshawn Goncalves</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyssa Wray</a>. Seacrest announced that Arthur was safe which meant it was the end of the line for the other three early standouts in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-twitter-was-fuming-after-the-results-were-announced>Twitter Was Fuming After the Results Were Announced</h3><p>Fans took Alyssa’s elimination pretty hard. Many pointed out that Arthur’s return to the competition took a spot away from her in the Top 7.</p><p>“This is pure BS. This is Alyssa Wray or Cassandra Coleman’s time. This is their season. It’s very UNFAIR that the man from past season elbowed them out. Very UNFAIR. This comeback twist is pure BS! I’m MAD and SAD,” wrote one viewer on Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is pure BS.

Now, he is re-competing for a chance to win on Season 19 in the most unexpected twist in American Idol history.</p><p>“I hate it for Alyssa definitely should have been in the top 7. I think Arthur is good but I also feel as if they’re really setting it up for him to win,” another fan wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I hate it for Alyssa definitely should have been in the top 7.

She looked like a Disney princess during this performance in a gorgeous dress and it was definitely her best performance of the entire competition. Fans thought so too until Arthur bested the Perryville, Kentucky teen in the voting.</p><p>“Alyssa should not have been eliminated.

It was a hard moment to watch as the judges gave the eliminated contestants a standing ovation.</p><p>“Arthur Gun shouldn’t have made it into #AmericanIdol Top 7.

Just Sam actually predicted in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an exclusive interview</a> that Arthur would win Season 19 of American Idol. It seems like many have the same idea that the season is now his to win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>If Arthur does end up winning the season, fans should not take their anger out on him. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It was the producer’s idea</a> to bring back last season’s contestants and grant them this chance. They know exactly how many votes he is capable of getting and wanted to up the ante in the competition.</p><p>Plus, fans are the ones that voted him through to the Top 7. While the Twitter crowd was pretty angry that Arthur went through and Alyssa went home, there are other groups of voters that are happy with the outcome. Do not be surprised if he makes it to the finale, knocking out some of the other fan favorites in the competition.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> ‘AMERICAN IDOL’S NEW TWIST POLARIZING FANS, IS THE COMEBACK FAIR?</a></strong></p>Something went wrong.

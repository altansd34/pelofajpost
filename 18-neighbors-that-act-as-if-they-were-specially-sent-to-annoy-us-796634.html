But you can choose the most interesting of&nbsp;the thousands of&nbsp;stories from users that got “lucky” enough to&nbsp;live near these extravagant people. Some of&nbsp;them ride scooters everywhere, leave trash in&nbsp;the elevator, and send weird letters.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were quite surprised that loud parties and screaming children weren’t the worst of&nbsp;these “bad neighbor” stories.</p><ul><li>We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very friendly neighborhood&nbsp;— we&nbsp;often talk on&nbsp;the playground. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;wasn’t surprised when a&nbsp;girl&nbsp;I didn’t know started talking to&nbsp;me. She was talking about how&nbsp;I could keep a&nbsp;man near me&nbsp;just by&nbsp;being the mother of&nbsp;his children and that this <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> was doomed. I&nbsp;didn’t understand what she was talking about but&nbsp;I just kept nodding. And then she said that she and my&nbsp;husband were in&nbsp;love and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;let him go&nbsp;and stop manipulating him using our daughter. The problem was, I&nbsp;wasn’t married. It&nbsp;turned out that the neighbor told her&nbsp;I was his wife so&nbsp;he&nbsp;wouldn’t have to&nbsp;marry her. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Overheard&nbsp;/ vk</a></li><li>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;neighbor that would constantly throw trash over their back fence into my&nbsp;yard. They did it&nbsp;all the time. During the summer, I&nbsp;would go&nbsp;out to&nbsp;the shed in&nbsp;the back and find the most random stuff, like a&nbsp;ripped-open stuffed animal, used diapers, etc. I&nbsp;started throwing the trash back over, but it&nbsp;kept coming back no&nbsp;matter how much&nbsp;I battled&nbsp;it. The terrible teen son would work on&nbsp;his car in&nbsp;the driveway and blast music all day long. They also used to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;basketball hoop in&nbsp;their driveway that they eventually took down. They discarded the hoop and backboard in&nbsp;our front yard off to&nbsp;the side like we&nbsp;wouldn’t notice. I&nbsp;kept pushing it&nbsp;back into their yard against the same fence they kept throwing trash over, but it&nbsp;somehow kept finding its way back into our yard. They were truly neighbors from hell. They eventually moved away and all the problems cleared&nbsp;up. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Itellsadstories&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>The aforementioned neighbors from hell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/145/c85/266dd5540e88958d330b35075e.jpg><ul readability=0.94513715710723><li readability=4.7256857855362><p>My&nbsp;upstairs neighbor really annoyed me&nbsp;with his music and there was nothing&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop him.

We&nbsp;noticed the wife was overly nice. You know, the type who’s wayyyy too nice to&nbsp;be&nbsp;real? So&nbsp;my&nbsp;fiancé left out of&nbsp;state and during one of&nbsp;those days my&nbsp;younger brother called me&nbsp;and told me&nbsp;he’d be&nbsp;around the area and wanted to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;we&nbsp;could grab lunch. I&nbsp;said sure and we&nbsp;went out for lunch. It&nbsp;had been a&nbsp;very long time since I’d seen my&nbsp;brother so&nbsp;when we&nbsp;met at&nbsp;the restaurant he&nbsp;was being very sweet. He&nbsp;would put his arm around my&nbsp;shoulder and we&nbsp;were just having a&nbsp;great time. From the corner of&nbsp;my&nbsp;eye, I&nbsp;felt someone looking my&nbsp;way. I&nbsp;turn around and there she was&nbsp;— my&nbsp;neighbor with her phone out. It&nbsp;seemed like she was taking a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;us. When she saw&nbsp;me, she quickly put the phone down and waved at&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;brother she was our neighbor and we&nbsp;went on&nbsp;with our day. My&nbsp;fiancé then texts me&nbsp;about an&nbsp;hour later: “The neighbor just sent me&nbsp;these pictures. She thinks you’re cheating on&nbsp;me&nbsp;with someone but&nbsp;I haven’t told her that’s your brother. Should I&nbsp;play along?” To&nbsp;this day, she cannot look me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the eye.

It&nbsp;was stuff like “2&nbsp;am, unit 2203: door to&nbsp;the unit is&nbsp;dirty; 5&nbsp;pm, unit 605: I&nbsp;can hear the television through their door.” One day&nbsp;I came home feeling good.

We&nbsp;introduced ourselves over the fence the first time but a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks into their stay, we&nbsp;started receiving letters. It&nbsp;was weird. The first letter stated that we&nbsp;were driving down our driveway too fast. Then a&nbsp;second letter arrived. They didn’t like that we&nbsp;were parking our cars in&nbsp;our driveways because seeing our vehicles ruined their view of&nbsp;the shared public park. They requested that we&nbsp;hide our vehicles behind the house or&nbsp;ensure that they were garaged. Also, every time we&nbsp;saw them, they would run to&nbsp;their house and act as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they didn’t know&nbsp;us. The final letter to&nbsp;arrive was a&nbsp;complaint that we&nbsp;were driving up&nbsp;and down our driveway too much and were disturbing their peace and quiet throughout the day and needed to&nbsp;park away from our houses so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;disturb them if&nbsp;we&nbsp;were going out more than a&nbsp;few times a&nbsp;day. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Michelle Steele&nbsp;/ quora</a></p></li></ul><p><h2>"The upstairs neighbors are loud.

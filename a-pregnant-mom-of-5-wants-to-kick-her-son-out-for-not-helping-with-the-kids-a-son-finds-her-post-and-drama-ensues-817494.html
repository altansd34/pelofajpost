<time>06 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Being a&nbsp;parent is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most adorable <a href=# title=jobs data-link=tag>jobs</a> in&nbsp;the world. And, probably, one of&nbsp;the toughest, too. Parents often look for help wherever they can, but some people end up&nbsp;looking for it&nbsp;not in&nbsp;the proper places. One woman took to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;complain that her son didn’t help her watch her other children, and people’s reactions were very emotional. And her other son has seen mom’s post online and also decided to&nbsp;respond.</p><p><h2>The woman turned to&nbsp;Reddit in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get at&nbsp;least some advice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6da/4dd/152a3e536086182b914e8d80df.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 46, wrote a&nbsp;post in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the Reddit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>communities</a>, telling people about her family circumstances and, in&nbsp;particular, about her <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her oldest son. She introduced herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother of&nbsp;5. She added that she’s five months pregnant. The woman detailed that she has twin girls who she’d call Lisa and Sophia, both 10&nbsp;years old; her youngest boy, Joshua is&nbsp;17, her <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a> girl, Emily is&nbsp;one, and her oldest son, Danny is&nbsp;21.</p><p>The woman wrote that they were on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hawaii data-link=tag>Hawaii</a> a&nbsp;few weeks ago, her husband didn’t come because of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unexpected work emergency, but he&nbsp;told them to&nbsp;have fun. The woman’s twins cried, a&nbsp;lot, so&nbsp;her son Joshua, and she comforted them, but Danny stood doing nothing.</p><p>The woman recalls that they had so&nbsp;many fun things planned to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with their father, but since he&nbsp;couldn’t come, they didn’t end up&nbsp;doing much. But whatever they did, (except eat) Danny was absent for&nbsp;it. The woman explained that, for example, going to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=beach data-link=tag>beach</a>, banana boats, Luaus, and watching his younger sisters when they just wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=pool data-link=tag>pool</a>, he’d stay in&nbsp;his room on&nbsp;his phone, chatting with his <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>.</p><p><h2>The woman got infuriated about her oldest son’s “laziness”.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/006/860/41edb35ecb9aa40f3f398e5f97.jpg><p>The woman continues her story, saying that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>relationship</a> between her son and her was becoming really tense. The next week of&nbsp;vacation, she was stressed with Danny. She admitted that she hated having to&nbsp;put most of&nbsp;the work on&nbsp;Josh because he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;have fun too, and her daughters were helping with the baby. She called him down to&nbsp;help, but he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;“wanted to&nbsp;relax and chill”.</p><p>The woman added that, in&nbsp;fact, they literally came there to&nbsp;relax, chill, and have fun, though they weren’t having lots of&nbsp;fun with less help, a&nbsp;crying baby, two ten-year-olds who wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the pool but had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what she had capability of&nbsp;doing while carrying, and her other son who wanted to&nbsp;get away from his sisters for at&nbsp;least an&nbsp;hour. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;mess.</p><p><h2>The mom-of-five finally lost her temper.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fe/e0b/ab95c85c36ade01865e01c2742.jpg><p>At&nbsp;one point, the woman felt like it&nbsp;was enough for her. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shouted</a> at&nbsp;her son, saying, “If&nbsp;you can’t step up&nbsp;and help the woman who gave birth to&nbsp;you, lets you live in&nbsp;her house rent-free, while giving you a&nbsp;job, whose money you just spend on&nbsp;silly games instead of&nbsp;getting an&nbsp;apartment, then you can get out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;house and pay for your own stuff.”</p><p>He&nbsp;looked shocked and left, and just about an&nbsp;hour after, the woman’s SIL, and also her in-laws called, asking her why she’d shout at&nbsp;her son when he&nbsp;did nothing.</p><p>She told them, “Yeah, he’s been doing nothing except eating and chatting in&nbsp;his room with his silly friends, instead of&nbsp;helping his mother and siblings” and hung&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>Mom decided to&nbsp;give some more explanation after people in&nbsp;the comments were infuriated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c70/b26/3d84f851a38f2a3adf4af66733.jpg><p>The woman made an&nbsp;edit to&nbsp;her initial post, after many users on&nbsp;Reddit came to&nbsp;the comments and told her that she was actually wrong. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a> the following information, “I&nbsp;should’ve added more details to&nbsp;avoid confusion. Danny does minimal work, I&nbsp;am not that type of&nbsp;parent. He&nbsp;babysits all day for one or&nbsp;twice a&nbsp;month when his dad and&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;have sometime alone. Josh also steps up&nbsp;as&nbsp;frequently as&nbsp;Danny, too.”</p><p>The woman gave more details about her other son, writing, “Danny does also have a&nbsp;job&nbsp;I gave him, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;introvert, stays in&nbsp;his room all day, everyday when he&nbsp;doesn’t have work which is&nbsp;only twice or&nbsp;three times a&nbsp;week, only gets out to&nbsp;eat or&nbsp;go&nbsp;out to&nbsp;parties to&nbsp;hang out with friends, other than that, I&nbsp;expect nothing less from him than, him keeping up&nbsp;good work in&nbsp;his job, and helping out every once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while with his sisters, just as&nbsp;Josh does, but his dad and I&nbsp;do on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis.”</p><p><h2>People in&nbsp;the comments were fuming because of&nbsp;the situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ef/3e1/d272e45ae5bf6d7aaa687f526d.jpg><p>The users of&nbsp;Reddit expressed their points of&nbsp;view, and the majority didn’t support the mom-of-5. One user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “It&nbsp;was your choice to&nbsp;give birth to&nbsp;5&nbsp;kids. Not Danny’s. And you gave birth to&nbsp;5&nbsp;KIDS, not 1&nbsp;kid and 4&nbsp;babysitters.”</p><p>Another user added, “What a&nbsp;nightmare. He’s not your husband or&nbsp;the father of&nbsp;your kids. Stop popping them out if&nbsp;you can’t handle so&nbsp;many. And I&nbsp;say this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent.”</p><p>The third person commented, “These are YOUR kids. Stop parentifying your other children to&nbsp;do&nbsp;childcare for you. If&nbsp;you can’t handle your own children, you shouldn’t have had so&nbsp;many. If&nbsp;you couldn’t handle them alone on&nbsp;vacation you shouldn’t have taken the vacation.”</p><p>But one comment was especially dramatic, because it&nbsp;was written by&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the woman’s sons.</p><p><h2>Danny, the woman’s younger son, came to&nbsp;the comments to&nbsp;tell his own view of&nbsp;the story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db8/d99/8aa3cd54718685893abf96fdbc.jpg><p>The whole story took an&nbsp;even more dramatic turn, when a&nbsp;woman’s son, Joshua, came to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comments</a> after he&nbsp;found mom’s post online. He&nbsp;expressed his point in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very emotional way, and wasn’t defending his mom at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The boy wrote, “You’re really funny like SO&nbsp;FUNNYY HAHA. I’m only posting this because I’ve been at&nbsp;nana’s for the past few weeks after this vacation. Which was not a&nbsp;vacation at&nbsp;all, not because of&nbsp;‘Danny’, but because of&nbsp;you. Are you the one always telling&nbsp;us that lies always catch up&nbsp;to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;the worst of&nbsp;times? Well, this is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. You don’t just put my&nbsp;brother to&nbsp;‘babysit’ for two days every few months or&nbsp;whatever. It’s every day, no&nbsp;matter what he&nbsp;has going&nbsp;on.”</p><p>The young man continues, not hiding his emotions, that seemed to&nbsp;overwhelm him, “You say to&nbsp;me&nbsp;no, no&nbsp;honey you have to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;your sisters, plan going out with friends for another week. Then that week you and your husband want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date and me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;brother are left taking care of&nbsp;your other offspring.”</p><p>Joshua finishes his comment, saying, “Now, don’t get me&nbsp;wrong. I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;sisters to&nbsp;death, but the lack of&nbsp;attention they get from you is&nbsp;rubbing off on&nbsp;me. They want to&nbsp;play Barbies more often with me&nbsp;or&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother, while you and your husband work or&nbsp;go&nbsp;out. My&nbsp;birthday’s next week, so&nbsp;I’ll be&nbsp;moving to&nbsp;nana’s the day after. So&nbsp;glad I’m turning 18. Oh, you also forgot to&nbsp;mention that the only reason your older son is&nbsp;still living with you in&nbsp;that monstrosity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;house is&nbsp;because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;autistic. You of&nbsp;all people should’ve mentioned that!”</p><p>And here’s yet another story with a&nbsp;big family dilemma. A&nbsp;woman kicked her <a href=#>pregnant daughter</a> out of&nbsp;her house, together with her 6&nbsp;kids, and explained the reason why she made this painful decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uvNGenqeZnql6rrvMZqafZWVixKK606xkraddoLakt4yhnKtlo6S7brvUrWSfp6Jiu7DAjKGcpaiZo7Ruw8itn2asmJp6rLXDrGSaZaOku26yyKebrGWYmr9uvM6sq2aZnpl6pb7ApphmnZ6owqa%2FjHFocGxpaXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-pregnant-mom-of-5-wants-to-kick-her-son-out-for-not-helping-with-the-kids-a-son-finds-her-post-and-drama-ensues-817494.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-pregnant-mom-of-5-wants-to-kick-her-son-out-for-not-helping-with-the-kids-a-son-finds-her-post-and-drama-ensues-817494.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-pregnant-mom-of-5-wants-to-kick-her-son-out-for-not-helping-with-the-kids-a-son-finds-her-post-and-drama-ensues-817494.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-pregnant-mom-of-5-wants-to-kick-her-son-out-for-not-helping-with-the-kids-a-son-finds-her-post-and-drama-ensues-817494.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-pregnant-mom-of-5-wants-to-kick-her-son-out-for-not-helping-with-the-kids-a-son-finds-her-post-and-drama-ensues-817494.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-pregnant-mom-of-5-wants-to-kick-her-son-out-for-not-helping-with-the-kids-a-son-finds-her-post-and-drama-ensues-817494.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-woman-shares-her-love-story-with-a-man-who-suffered-burns-on-80-of-his-body-813923.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-woman-shares-her-love-story-with-a-man-who-suffered-burns-on-80-of-his-body-813923.html>A Woman Shares Her Love Story With a Man Who Suffered Burns on 80% of His Body</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1403039-50-ridiculous-wine-puns-jokes-memes-quotes-sayings-html.html>50+ ridiculous wine puns, jokes, memes, quotes and sayings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1403039-50-ridiculous-wine-puns-jokes-memes-quotes-sayings-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

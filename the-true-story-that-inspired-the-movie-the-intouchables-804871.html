<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It&nbsp;often happens that we&nbsp;focus so&nbsp;much on&nbsp;the things we&nbsp;don’t have that we&nbsp;forget about what we&nbsp;do&nbsp;have. That’s actually a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;our shortcomings and the barriers that stop&nbsp;us from being our ideal selves. We’re postponing our <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;the disappointment of&nbsp;not being who we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be. But sometimes, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;dare to&nbsp;break <a href=# title=down data-link=tag>down</a> our prejudices and open our hearts, there are people who, regardless of&nbsp;race, social class, or&nbsp;age, can show&nbsp;us not only our virtues but also how valuable we&nbsp;are to&nbsp;the world.</p><p>And if&nbsp;you don’t believe&nbsp;us, <strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you the stories of&nbsp;Count Philippe Pozzo di&nbsp;Borgo and Abdel Yasmin Sellou, 2&nbsp;men who felt unable to&nbsp;move forward but whose <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> overcame social classes, changed their lives and inspired a&nbsp;movie.</p><p><h2>Who Philippe Pozzo di&nbsp;Borgo&nbsp;is</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/521/f71/09af7d5c3da0a6919aca7f9380.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Philippe Pozzo di&nbsp;Borgo</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;French count, businessman, and owner of&nbsp;an&nbsp;important <a href=# title=hotel data-link=tag>hotel</a>. The son of&nbsp;a&nbsp;duke, he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;opulent family with all the luxuries and comforts that allowed him to&nbsp;study, marry, and have important jobs, such as&nbsp;manager of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Moët &&nbsp;Chandon</a>. With a&nbsp;promising future, Philippe’s life was enviable; however, in&nbsp;1993, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;paragliding accident that left him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tetraplegia</a>.</p><p>Unable to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;his own and with his wife then suffering from cancer, Philippe entered a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;depression that led him to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;unsuccessful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attempt</a> at&nbsp;taking his own life. For him, the sadness “was unbearable because&nbsp;I was always in&nbsp;control, and suddenly&nbsp;I was dependent on&nbsp;everyone, especially a&nbsp;wife who was ill.”</p><p><h2>Abdel Yasmin Sellou’s background confirmed he&nbsp;was far from being an&nbsp;employee of&nbsp;the month.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/514/4af/f707e85ffdbcfe1322469f894b.jpg><p>Abdel might be&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;person you would think twice, maybe 3&nbsp;times about before hiring. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lived</a> his <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;humble conditions with 8&nbsp;siblings, developing an&nbsp;impulsive personality and a&nbsp;very bad temper. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;10, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a> to&nbsp;live with relatives who could take care of&nbsp;him, and at&nbsp;16, he&nbsp;was expelled from school because he&nbsp;stole from his classmates. Far from correcting himself, at&nbsp;18, he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;jail for the first time for stealing cameras from tourists. With such questionable actions at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age, Abdel’s future was bleak. But if&nbsp;there was one thing that made him special as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person, it&nbsp;was his charisma that captivated and endeared others from the very first moment they met him.</p><p>While serving a&nbsp;one-and-a-half-year prison sentence, he&nbsp;was given the opportunity to&nbsp;get out in&nbsp;10&nbsp;months if&nbsp;he&nbsp;reinserted himself into society by&nbsp;attending mechanics courses. Unfortunately, he&nbsp;realized that he&nbsp;didn’t like mechanics and had to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;quick job, whatever it&nbsp;was, as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;it&nbsp;kept him from going back to&nbsp;prison. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;applying for a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;caretaker for a&nbsp;millionaire aristocrat and tetraplegic and his sick wife. Little did he&nbsp;know that the job would change his life.</p><p><h2>Hiring him was the worst idea in&nbsp;the world, but it&nbsp;brought the best results.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d47/974/ef163052ed94c9470e30a4f31b.jpg><p>After reading about Philippe’s wealthy family and his good upbringing, some people might be&nbsp;left wondering why someone, as&nbsp;refined as&nbsp;him, would hire someone like Abdel. For starters, Philippe, throughout his working life, had conducted many job interviews and saw in&nbsp;Abdel an&nbsp;employee with potential beyond his bad-boy looks. “He&nbsp;didn’t feel sorry for&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;was irreverent, cheeky, and had an&nbsp;outrageous sense of&nbsp;humor. I&nbsp;suddenly found that&nbsp;I was enjoying life again,” Philippe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> in&nbsp;justifying his decision.</p><p>Philippe and Abdel would often pull <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pranks</a>, like getting pulled over by&nbsp;police for speeding and convincing them that they were rushing to&nbsp;the hospital. As&nbsp;Phillipe said, “I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;back on&nbsp;track. Pity is&nbsp;the last thing you need. Pity is&nbsp;hopeless. Pity is&nbsp;what someone gives you because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;you.” He&nbsp;also felt that Abdel was the perfect person for him and said, “I&nbsp;don’t care that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;out of&nbsp;jail. I&nbsp;needed him. And he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;friend afterward.”</p><p><h2>Their differences brought them together when they discovered that they both needed healing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0b/a3e/b885005fb280ad409717c097d1.jpg><p>Abdel brought good humor, spontaneity, and humbleness, which contrasted greatly with the norms of&nbsp;etiquette to&nbsp;which Philippe was accustomed. But bit by&nbsp;bit, Philippe healed from depression thanks to&nbsp;that. “He&nbsp;treated me&nbsp;as&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated,” the count <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a>. Abdel, with his unorthodox care, was able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;jogging in&nbsp;Philippe’s company and hang onto his wheelchair to&nbsp;create adrenaline-pumping situations by&nbsp;driving outside the speed limits with Philippe as&nbsp;co-driver, for example. These extremely crazy situations gave Philippe a&nbsp;joy of&nbsp;life again and broke the monotony of&nbsp;his routine.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;friendship that saved them and touched many hearts</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a4/432/ec8b105215876ab3c4739b4e71.jpg><p>Abdel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went into</a> what it&nbsp;was like before they became friends: “We&nbsp;were 2&nbsp;desperate people looking for a&nbsp;way out; the rich man mad with grief over the death of&nbsp;his wife and the young gangster just out of&nbsp;jail who wanted to&nbsp;blow it&nbsp;all&nbsp;up.&nbsp;2&nbsp;outcasts supporting each other.” And after 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;mutual companionship and learning, in&nbsp;2003, their paths parted during a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;Morocco, where they both found partners. “Abdel and&nbsp;I ended our collaboration when we&nbsp;both found our soul mates,” explained Philippe, adding that their time together, like a&nbsp;story that unfolds in&nbsp;the best way, ended “without sadness or&nbsp;difficulty.”</p><p>Philippe married a&nbsp;Muslim woman, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;his wife’s home country to&nbsp;raise a&nbsp;family with her. Abdel also married at&nbsp;about the same time and now runs a&nbsp;poultry farm in&nbsp;Algeria and has 3&nbsp;children who call Philippe their uncle. “Before, he&nbsp;wouldn’t have even asked me&nbsp;about settling down,” Abdel said. “I&nbsp;was simply interested in&nbsp;women if&nbsp;they were fast food. Now I’m settled, focused on&nbsp;my&nbsp;new life.” After that life-changing friendship, both men wrote books based on&nbsp;their own perspectives. Abdel wrote <i>You Have Changed My&nbsp;Life</i>, and Philippe wrote <i>Untouchable</i>, the name that inspired the French film based on&nbsp;their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/013/3a8/e98db05d128aa03d11d68e1abc.jpg><p>Nowadays, Abdel travels to&nbsp;Morocco from time to&nbsp;time to&nbsp;visit his friend, Philippe, and when they don’t see each other in&nbsp;person, Philippe is&nbsp;the one who calls him to&nbsp;hear about his adventures and wacky occurrences. Both show that the most affluent or&nbsp;humble person can live through great adversity. But just as&nbsp;problems don’t distinguish between classes, neither do&nbsp;friendship nor affection. And even when we&nbsp;feel we’re falling, there is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;helping hand that can invite&nbsp;us to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;our comfort zone to&nbsp;surpass ourselves.</p><p>What did you like most about the story?

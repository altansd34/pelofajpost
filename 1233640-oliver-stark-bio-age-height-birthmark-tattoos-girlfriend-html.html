He has a remarkable appearance, and many people remember him due to the curious birthmark he has in his left eye area. However, this facial feature is not the only thing people notice about him.

What is there in his background?</h2><p class=align-left>The future star was born in London, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on June 27, 1991</a>. The family was far from being wealthy. There was one more child in the family: Oliver’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">elder brother</a>. Due to the low incomes, the boy had no chance of attending any higher educational institution except for Hendon School.</p><p class=align-left>Instead of studying and receiving higher education and scientific degrees like many young persons of his age, the future star needed to work hard and change a whole <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">range of jobs</a>. Some of them seem very weird from the point of view of his today’s career but what else a young person without a professional qualification could do? So, the young man was forced to work as a salesman who walks from door to door offering things, as a cleaner, an operator of a call centre, and eventually as a promoter for a nightclub.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27d21de417f49348.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Garcia: Facts about his boxing career, age, family, and net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Megan Olivi bio: age, height, husband and hot photos</p><p class=align-left>It is hardly possible and fair to say that it was a kind of professional experience. However, it has taught the young man how to survive in harsh conditions and showed him life from different sides. This knowledge can be beneficial for an actor.</p><p class=align-left>Then, in a certain while, Stark tried his hand at acting and was successfully cast for a short film titled “Follow”. Then, new roles fell upon the young man like rain. First, he received small parts in single episodes of TV shows like “Casualty”, “Big Bad World”, and others. After 2012, he starred in feature films like “Montana” (released in 2014), “MindGamers” (released in 2017), and others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f88c94b2264a3503.jpg><p class=align-left>Eventually, the young celebrity received a regular role in “Into the Badlands” and appeared in 16 episodes. It was a big success for such young talent who has never even studied drama or arts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/53e31a382fb56195.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover what Noah Munck, aka Gibby from iCarly, is doing now</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is interesting that the role in “9-1-1” had influenced Mr Stark so much that he started to support the national foundation that helps fallen firefighters. It has become possible for him now due to new earnings. His net worth had grown significantly since the days when he used to change other jobs. Now it is estimated at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nearly $2 million</a>.</p><h2>Is Oliver Stark birthmark real?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27d21de417f49348.jpg><p class=align-left>Every actor needs to have a specific feature that makes him or her unique. Some are exceptionally tall or small; others have very specific smiles, bright eyes, unusual facial features or voices. It is a rare situation for a male or a female celebrity to have a distinctive feature that is usually considered a skin imperfection. However, Oliver Stark birth mark has become such a unique thing that makes the young man different from all others. In his case, this mark on his face only makes his features more expressive and distinctive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ab461a0c39f50086.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jace Norman’s bio: age, height, girlfriend, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As the actor says, it is not a consequence of a virus like herpes or something of the kind, and it is not a health issue in any case. It is just a spot; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">it never bothers him</a> with unpleasant physical feelings, and neither has it ever caused him negative emotions.</p><p class=align-left>The question of whether it is real has emerged due to the fact that there are pictures of the star where the mark is not seen. It is either edited away from those pictures or hidden with the help of some makeup. To make things clear, the mark really exists, and it is in the left eye area. Some pictures of the young man are mirrored in the process of editing, and this brings in only more confusion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4aaa469d8506a6b1.png><p class=align-left>In everyday life, people usually remove such marks from their faces and often think that actors should do the same to look perfect. However, this Oliver Stark eye area birthmark is definitely not the thing that should be removed. It is his individual feature that makes his face unique. It may be more important for an actor than having a perfect but ordinary face.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bb92e02cbf2336.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A quick look at the amazing life of Patrick Duffy</span></p></a><h2>What about Oliver Stark tattoos?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/53e31a382fb56195.jpg><p class=align-left>The young man has several tattoos on his body.

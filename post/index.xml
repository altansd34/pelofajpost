I&amp;nbsp;know, your first thought was probably a&amp;nbsp;whale or&amp;nbsp;some large tree, like the Sequoia. Surprisingly, if&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;look at&amp;nbsp;square footage, the largest single living organism is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;species of&amp;nbsp;mycelium called Armillaria Ostoyae or&amp;nbsp;the honey mushroom. And you can find it&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Oregon’s Malheur National Forest. It&amp;nbsp;stretches across 3&amp;nbsp;square miles! Not only is&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;the largest, but it’s also thought to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;the oldest organism as&amp;nbsp;well, estimated to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;around 8,000 years old!

That’s actually a&amp;nbsp;way of&amp;nbsp;focusing on&amp;nbsp;our shortcomings and the barriers that stop&amp;nbsp;us from being our ideal selves. We’re postponing our happiness in&amp;nbsp;the face of&amp;nbsp;the disappointment of&amp;nbsp;not being who we&amp;nbsp;want to&amp;nbsp;be. But sometimes, if&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;dare to&amp;nbsp;break down our prejudices and open our hearts, there are people who, regardless of&amp;nbsp;race, social class, or&amp;nbsp;age, can show&amp;nbsp;us not only our virtues but also how valuable we&amp;nbsp;are to&amp;nbsp;the world.</description></item><item><title>Tim Duncan bio: wife, height, net worth, championships</title><link>/1308991-tim-duncan-bio-wife-height-net-worth-championships-html.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/1308991-tim-duncan-bio-wife-height-net-worth-championships-html.html</guid><description>Recently, Gregg Popovich's assistant in the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA) was announced, and he is none other than Tim Duncan.

However, a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;the times that’s not the case, and those people don’t deserve to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;treated like outcasts. All they’re guilty of&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;being different, probably even in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;positive way.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side think being the black sheep of&amp;nbsp;the family is&amp;nbsp;actually a&amp;nbsp;good thing in&amp;nbsp;many cases. And here’s why.

However, an&amp;nbsp;intriguing discovery made by&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;Twitter user sheds light on&amp;nbsp;something peculiar about his style evolution. Like a&amp;nbsp;chameleon, Pitt has adapted his looks over the years to&amp;nbsp;align with each new woman he&amp;nbsp;has been romantically involved with.
Shalene McCall
During Brad Pitt’s appearance in&amp;nbsp;four episodes of&amp;nbsp;Dallas in&amp;nbsp;1987, the actor, who was 24&amp;nbsp;years old at&amp;nbsp;the time, had a&amp;nbsp;controversial relationship with his co-star, Shalane McCall.</description></item><item><title>11 Celebrities Who Paused Their Career to Take Care of Their Families</title><link>/10-celebrities-who-decided-to-put-their-careers-on-hold-and-be-with-their-families-806948.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/10-celebrities-who-decided-to-put-their-careers-on-hold-and-be-with-their-families-806948.html</guid><description>When we&amp;nbsp;think of&amp;nbsp;celebrities, we&amp;nbsp;generally imagine their luxurious lives and we&amp;nbsp;frequently overlook the fact that they are people very much like&amp;nbsp;us.

That’s why a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;celebrities gave up&amp;nbsp;their career to&amp;nbsp;raise their children.

But, as&amp;nbsp;the movie was shot between July and August 2013, they were actually younger. Anyway, that’s a&amp;nbsp;34-year age difference. And this isn’t an&amp;nbsp;anomaly. It&amp;nbsp;happens far more often than you can imagine.

The users try to&amp;nbsp;consider every little detail: the location, the clothes, the pose, the facial expressions, and the accessories.

There was nothing unusual about him at&amp;nbsp;first glance: he&amp;nbsp;was elegantly dressed, with no&amp;nbsp;distinguishing features. He&amp;nbsp;was just a&amp;nbsp;simple man sporting a&amp;nbsp;beard. He&amp;nbsp;made his way to&amp;nbsp;customs, just as&amp;nbsp;all the other people surrounding him.

Although some people claim Germans are unemotional (a totally untrue stereotype, by the way), the German language is filled with words to describe complex emotions. And what’s more, these words have no equivalent in the English language.

But for some reason, they don’t often talk about what happens after the wedding, so&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;are left thinking that people are incredibly happy. However, not everyone manages to&amp;nbsp;become truly happy in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;marriage, so&amp;nbsp;some people choose to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;alone.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side think that there are a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;women with a&amp;nbsp;similar story like the one from this article.

In&amp;nbsp;Europe and the&amp;nbsp;US, people don’t want to&amp;nbsp;put up&amp;nbsp;with this, and they do&amp;nbsp;something called dumpster diving. People literally dive into dumpsters to&amp;nbsp;try to&amp;nbsp;find things that can still be&amp;nbsp;used.

The Greeks would incorporate illusions into their art and architecture, and our fascination with them has continued to&amp;nbsp;this day. This is&amp;nbsp;because our brains can become muddled while trying to&amp;nbsp;comprehend what we’re actually looking&amp;nbsp;at.
Bright Side loves to&amp;nbsp;explore puzzles, so&amp;nbsp;today we’ve collected 10&amp;nbsp;different illusions to&amp;nbsp;put your mind to&amp;nbsp;work.

However, with such a&amp;nbsp;title comes great responsibility and some strict rules that must be&amp;nbsp;followed regardless of&amp;nbsp;age. We&amp;nbsp;know that little royals are kids after all, but some of&amp;nbsp;the guidelines they have to&amp;nbsp;follow remind&amp;nbsp;us of&amp;nbsp;how their upbringing is&amp;nbsp;worlds apart from our own childhood.

As&amp;nbsp;Oscar Wilde once said, “Sarcasm is&amp;nbsp;the lowest form of&amp;nbsp;wit, but the highest form of&amp;nbsp;intelligence.” Many people will use this tool to&amp;nbsp;make fun of&amp;nbsp;themselves and an&amp;nbsp;aspect of&amp;nbsp;their lives that they realize could be&amp;nbsp;better. The results are usually super funny, creating a&amp;nbsp;whirlwind of&amp;nbsp;mixed emotions.

The closer a&amp;nbsp;show is&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;real life and existing people, the closer viewers will feel to&amp;nbsp;it. That’s why people get the most attached to&amp;nbsp;sitcoms and comedy movies, since their themes are closer to&amp;nbsp;regular life. In&amp;nbsp;that manner, it&amp;nbsp;shouldn’t come as&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;surprise that people crave to&amp;nbsp;see their favorite shows back on&amp;nbsp;the air or&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;least their stars reunited even for a&amp;nbsp;short period of&amp;nbsp;time.</description></item><item><title>20 Celebs Who Are the Spitting Images of Other People</title><link>/20-celebs-who-are-the-spitting-images-of-other-people-794029.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/20-celebs-who-are-the-spitting-images-of-other-people-794029.html</guid><description>With so&amp;nbsp;many celebrities around, sometimes it’s hard to&amp;nbsp;keep up&amp;nbsp;with who’s who. However, that task gets a&amp;nbsp;million times harder once you realize so&amp;nbsp;many of&amp;nbsp;them share mind-blowing resemblances with each other. With that in&amp;nbsp;mind, Bright Side made this list of&amp;nbsp;celebrities who could very well be&amp;nbsp;related to&amp;nbsp;each other, given how much they look alike. Feel free to&amp;nbsp;use it&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;guide, but be&amp;nbsp;warned it&amp;nbsp;will leave you puzzled for a&amp;nbsp;while.

Some people may have their mother’s eyes, or&amp;nbsp;their father’s nose, but others have found their doppelgänger among their ancestors.
Bright Side did some web surfing and found a&amp;nbsp;few people that are living proof of&amp;nbsp;how strong genes can&amp;nbsp;be.
1. “My&amp;nbsp;direct paternal grandfather and&amp;nbsp;I, born 506 years apart.”

And most likely, he&amp;nbsp;would’ve valued a&amp;nbsp;piece of&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;old map more than a&amp;nbsp;chest full of&amp;nbsp;gold. But it’s not very likely that Davy Jones would be&amp;nbsp;the head of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;crew of&amp;nbsp;pirates. Actually, he&amp;nbsp;would’ve most likely been an&amp;nbsp;innkeeper or&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;simple sailor that would often fall overboard because of&amp;nbsp;his vision problems.

Prince William and Kate, Princess of&amp;nbsp;Wales, face this unique situation as&amp;nbsp;they raise their three children—Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.
Understanding that their children are destined to&amp;nbsp;step into the spotlight one day, William and Kate strive to&amp;nbsp;balance the amount of&amp;nbsp;public exposure their children receive to&amp;nbsp;ensure a&amp;nbsp;relatively normal and quiet childhood. This balance is&amp;nbsp;achieved by&amp;nbsp;often defying royal tradition and opting to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;much of&amp;nbsp;the parenting themselves, rather than relying heavily on&amp;nbsp;outside staff like tutors and nannies.</description></item><item><title>Belief in QAnon Wavers Slightly Among Adults After Capitol Riots, Inauguration</title><link>/qanon-beliefs-polling.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/qanon-beliefs-polling.html</guid><description>Focusing energy on moderating QAnon’s social media forums seems to be the most fruitful approach to stemming the tide of misinformation.

But Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a media watchdog that monitors “conservative misinformation,” said many of the measures taken by mainstream social media sites appear to be reactionary and not preventive, an approach that he said falls short of fully combatting the growth of QAnon and other extremist groups.</description></item><item><title>Black Mom With Ginger Albino Baby Reveals What She Does to Make Him Feel Included in the Family</title><link>/black-mom-with-ginger-albino-baby-reveals-what-she-does-to-make-him-feel-included-in-the-family-817327.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/black-mom-with-ginger-albino-baby-reveals-what-she-does-to-make-him-feel-included-in-the-family-817327.html</guid><description>Vivienne Temitope Hassan, a&amp;nbsp;24-year-old content creator, recently shared her unique story.

To&amp;nbsp;make them look younger, makeup artists may be&amp;nbsp;inspired by&amp;nbsp;old photographs of&amp;nbsp;themselves at&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;younger age; but to&amp;nbsp;age them, that’s another story. In&amp;nbsp;those cases, the characterization is&amp;nbsp;done based on&amp;nbsp;how they might age, and it&amp;nbsp;may not be&amp;nbsp;how they will age later in&amp;nbsp;real life, as&amp;nbsp;that process depends on&amp;nbsp;many factors.
Bright Side compiled stills of&amp;nbsp;movies in&amp;nbsp;which actors were aged to&amp;nbsp;play their characters and compared them with current pictures of&amp;nbsp;them at&amp;nbsp;that age to&amp;nbsp;see how accurate the characterization was.</description></item><item><title>How many castles are in Germany?</title><link>/how-many-castles-in-germany.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-many-castles-in-germany.html</guid><description>Among Germany’s vast forests and impressive medieval towns lie its enchanting castles.

As early as 1440 the city of Aberdeen is known to have put on its own set of 'mystery plays' which were performed by the city's own craft guilds. The Halloween tradition of 'guising', which still exists today can also be traced back to these early performances.</p><p>The <a class="link link--external" href=#>National Theatre of Scotland</a> (NTS) is Scotland's national theatre and performing company. Launched in 2006, NTS has no central location. Instead, the company takes theatre to the people of Scotland – and beyond – by performing anywhere they can connect to an audience, including airports and high-rises, forests and ferries, drill halls and football pitches, pubs and factories.</p><p>In contemporary Scotland, theatre continues to be vibrant, imaginative and profoundly affecting. Many of Scotland’s finest productions find their way onto stages around the world. Scotland’s major venues include the <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Royal Lyceum</a>, the <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Citizens’</a> and <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Dundee Rep</a> alongside smaller venues such as <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Comar</a>, &nbsp;<a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>The Barn</a> and <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Lyth Arts Centre</a>, which with others such as <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Aberdeen Performing Arts</a>, the <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Beacon </a>and <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Platform</a> ensure that our venues connect with urban and rural communities across the country presenting the best in Scottish, UK and international theatre.</p><h2>Opera</h2><p>Scottish opera can be traced back to the early 18th century with the first ever Scottish opera, The Gentle Shepherd published by poet Allan Ramsay in 1725. Although a number of operas have been set in Scotland , or based around Scottish themes, the most common themes of Scottish opera are still heavily influenced by Italian, French and German models.</p><p><a class="link link--external" href=#>Scottish Opera</a> is Scotland's national opera company and the largest performing arts organisation in Scotland, performing in over 50 theatres, village halls and community centres in Scotland and the UK each year. Notable achievements include the world premiere of James MacMillan's Ines de Castro at the 1996 Edinburgh International Festival and Wagner's complete Ring Cycle at the 2003 Edinburgh International Festival. The Company celebrated its 50th birthday on in June, 2012.</p><h2>Dance</h2><p>In Scotland, you are nevermore than a 'pas de bourree' away from a dance class, competition or performance. From traditional Scottish Highland and ceilidh dancing, to ballet, contemporary and street dance, the country celebrates a whole host of dance forms.</p><p><a class="link link--external" href=#>Scottish Ballet</a> is Scotland's national dance company, based at the Tramway in Glasgow. Employing 36 professional dancers and an orchestra of up to 70 musicians, Scottish Ballet's primary aim is to provide programmes of world-class dance performance and educational activity at all scales. The company performs its broad repertoire throughout Scotland and around the world, which includes both classical and contemporary works from Sleeping Beauty to The Nutcracker and A Streetcar Named Desire.</p><p><a class="link link--external" href=#>Scottish Dance Theatre</a> (SDT) is Scotland's national contemporary dance company and is based at Dundee Rep Theatre. The company's programme includes work by internationally celebrated and emerging choreographers with a repertoire that is constantly evolving, pushing boundaries and expectations. The company tours throughout the UK and internationally. Along with providing a unique education program and access to dance for all, Scottish Dance Theatre collaborates with artists of outstanding calibre in the fields of music, design and the visual arts to produce dance of the highest quality.</p><h2>International Performance Festivals</h2><p>Edinburgh hosts, arguably, the most famous annual arts festival in the world – the <a class="link link--external" href=#>Edinburgh International Festival</a>, which – for three weeks over August - sees Edinburgh's six major theatres and concert halls, a few smaller venues and often some unconventional ones too, come alive with the best professional classical music, theatre, dance and visual art from around the globe.</p><p>The associated <a class="link link--external" href=#>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a> brings thousands of performers to the city, from big names in the world of entertainment to unknown artists looking to build their careers. The festival includes theatre, opera, dance, comedy, music, exhibitions and various events.</p><p>Scotland plays host to a wide variety of additional theatre festivals, such as Glasgow's <a class="link link--external" href=#>Bard in the Botanics</a>, where classic Shakespeare is performed against the backdrop of Glasgow's internationally famous gardens.</p><p>Every year in May, <a class="link link--external" href=#>Burns an' a' That!</a> festival in Ayrshire brings together international performers with local people to celebrate Scotland's internationally acclaimed poet Robert Burns.</p><h2>Venues</h2><p>The country boasts a wealth of fine auditoriums and theatres which host many big touring shows as well as exclusive one-night events.</p><p>Edinburgh is home to the largest all-seated auditorium in the UK - <a class="link link--external" href=#>The Edinburgh Playhouse</a> - as well as the Usher Hall, the King's Theatre, the Royal Lyceum Theatre, the Traverse Theatre and the famous Festival Theatre, amongst others.</p><p>Meanwhile, through in Glasgow, there is a plethora of theatres to choose from, including the King's Theatre, the Pavilion Theatre, the Tramway, the Tron, the Citizens Theatre and the Theatre Royal, to name but a few.</p><p>Outwith the major cities, there are many theatres throughout the country bursting with creative talent and thought-provoking performances. There's the Dundee Rep Theatre, the Pitlochry Festival Theatre in rural Perthshire, the Eastgate Arts Centre in Peebles and Eden Court in Inverness, not to mention An Lanntair in Stornoway, the Theatre Royal in Dumfries, Mull Theatre on the Isle of Mull, and the Byre Theatre in St Andrews.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjpqZqK2kYsCku9OlmKecX5jCrcDUq5xop6Cav6J506GcmqyimnqiusNmm5qmk5o%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fopera-theatre-and-dance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fopera-theatre-and-dance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fopera-theatre-and-dance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fopera-theatre-and-dance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fopera-theatre-and-dance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fopera-theatre-and-dance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rag-n-bone-man.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rag-n-bone-man.html>Rag n Bone Man popularity &amp;amp; fame</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./19432-most-brits-only-think-six-ten-commandments-are-sti.html>Most Brits think only six of the Ten Commandments are still important</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./19432-most-brits-only-think-six-ten-commandments-are-sti.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

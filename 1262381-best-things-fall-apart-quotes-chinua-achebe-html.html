There is no one for whom it is well.</li><li>To show affection was a sign of weakness; the only thing worth demonstrating was strength.</li><li>Living fire begets cold, impotent ash.</li><li>Our elders say that the sun will shine on those who stand before it shines on those who kneel under them.</li><li>No matter how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and his children (and especially his women) he was not really a man.</li><li>There was a saying in Umuofia that as a man danced so the drums were beaten for him.</li><li>Eneke the bird says that since men have learned to shoot without missing, he has learned to fly without perching.</li><li>A child cannot pay for its mother’s milk.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7dd6c9205415b000.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>See person client: Reactions as oyinbo man sings Pasuma's fuji song fluently, speaks Yoruba in video</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6e9338da795b00ff.jpg><h2>Thoughtful Chinua Achebe quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Things Fall Apart important quotes indeed prove that Chinua was a deep thinker.</p><li>Among the Igbo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten.</li><li>A man who calls his kinsmen to a feast does not do so to save them from starving. They all have food in their own homes. When we gather together in the moonlit village ground it is not because of the moon. Every man can see it in his own compound. We come together because it is good for kinsmen to do so.</li><li>Mr. Brown had thought of nothing but numbers. He should have known that the kingdom of God did not depend on large crowds. Our Lord Himself stressed the importance of fewness. Narrow is the way and few the number. To fill the Lord's holy temple with an idolatrous crowd clamoring for signs was a folly of everlasting consequence. Our Lord used the whip only once in His life - to drive the crowd away from His church.</li><li>The world has no end, and what is good among one people is an abomination with others.</li><li>We do not ask for wealth because he that has health and children will also have wealth. We do not pray to have money but to have more kinsmen. We are better than animals because we have kinsmen. An animal rubs its itching flank against a tree, a man asks his kinsman to scratch him.”</li><li>Do not despair. I know you will not despair. You have a manly and a proud heart. A proud heart can survive a general failure because such a failure does not pr**k its pride. It is more difficult and more bitter when a man fails alone.</li><li>If you don't like my story, write your own</li><li>The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now he has won our brothers, and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.</li><li>When the moon is shining the cripple becomes hungry for a walk</li><li>Fortunately, among these people a man was judged according to his worth and not according to the worth of his father.</li><li>How do you think we can fight when our own brothers have turned against us?</li><li>Age was respected among his people, but achievement was revered. As the elders said, if a child washed his hands he could eat with kings.</li><li>You do not know me,’ said Tortoise. ‘I am a changed man. I have learned that a man who makes trouble for others makes trouble for himself.</li><li>It’s true that a child belongs to its father. But when a father beats his child, it seeks sympathy in its mother’s hut. A man belongs to his fatherland when things are good and life is sweet. But when there is sorrow and bitterness he finds refuge in his motherland. Your mother is there to protect you. She is buried there. And that is why we say that mother is supreme.</li><li>The air, which had been stretched taut with excitement, relaxed again.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9585140fa571690c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>From grace to grass: Internet sensation Mr Spellz spotted in new video begging at mall, Nigerians ignored him</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7dd6c9205415b000.jpg><h2>Things Fall Apart quotes with page numbers</h2><p class=align-left>Are you still wondering why Chinua Achebe wrote Things Fall Apart?

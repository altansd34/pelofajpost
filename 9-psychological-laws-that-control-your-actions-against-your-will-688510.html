<time>24 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There are many events that take place in&nbsp;our life that are often hard to&nbsp;understand. How do&nbsp;fortune-tellers predict the future so&nbsp;precisely and why are broken windows so&nbsp;disturbing? Scientists have already created theories that explain what these things mean that happen around&nbsp;us. It&nbsp;turns out that people act according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;script and our behavior is&nbsp;actually pretty predictable.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have read many <a href=# title=psychological data-link=tag>psychological</a> books and today we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;share some secret knowledge with you&nbsp;— everything that happens to&nbsp;you is&nbsp;not random. People’s strange actions can also be&nbsp;explained with the help of&nbsp;science.</p><p><h2>1. The theory of&nbsp;learned helplessness</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f8/ca6/9cbcd15effa077c95a8d584b48.jpg><p>Learned helplessness is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>behavioral disorder</a> where a&nbsp;person isn’t trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;improve their life, even though they have the opportunity to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something about&nbsp;it. Why is&nbsp;it&nbsp;called “learned”? Because no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;born with the idea that overcoming obstacles is&nbsp;useless. This thought appears after going through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stress</a> or&nbsp;multiple failures. People give up&nbsp;and start believing that nothing is&nbsp;dependent on&nbsp;them, especially after having received numerous blows from life itself.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life:</strong> A&nbsp;person has failed the tests needed to&nbsp;get into a&nbsp;university twice, they work hard for very little money, and they can’t break up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;toxic spouse. The solution seems quite simple: prepare for the exam, find another job, get divorced, and your problems will disappear. But someone driven into helplessness doesn’t see an&nbsp;easy way out and will continue to&nbsp;tolerate the pain.</p><p><strong>What to&nbsp;do?</strong></p><ul><li>Forget about being perfect&nbsp;— there are very few things that you can do&nbsp;100% perfect in&nbsp;life.</li><li>Decrease your expectations, including the negative ones. We&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;trouble even though it&nbsp;hasn’t happened yet.</li><li>Learn to&nbsp;stay optimistic. There is&nbsp;something called learned optimism, and you can acquire it&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;several exercises.</li></ul><p><h2>2. The theory of&nbsp;broken windows</h2></p><p>The criminology <strong>theory of&nbsp;broken windows</strong> was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>implemented</a> by&nbsp;2&nbsp;American sociologists: L.&nbsp;Kelling and James Q. Wilson. These scientists were trying to&nbsp;figure out the reason for the increasing crime rates in&nbsp;New York City in&nbsp;the 80s. They came to&nbsp;the following conclusion: minor offenses like scattered garbage or&nbsp;graffiti actively affected the crime level in&nbsp;general.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life</strong>: If&nbsp;there’s at&nbsp;least one broken or&nbsp;missing window in&nbsp;a&nbsp;building, people passing by&nbsp;assume that no&nbsp;one cares for the building and that there are no&nbsp;responsible people to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;the mess. After a&nbsp;short time, all the windows will be&nbsp;broken, while the people living in&nbsp;this area will become more confident in&nbsp;their ability to&nbsp;get away with things. Moreover, they will soon conclude that they won’t get punished for more severe crimes.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fan</a> of&nbsp;this theory, Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of&nbsp;New York (1994), managed to&nbsp;decrease the crime level in&nbsp;the city by&nbsp;half.</p><p><h2>3. The theory of&nbsp;a&nbsp;reality tunnel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ac/65e/18471e5d188495c2e8a6e6b215.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>this theory</a>, a&nbsp;person sees the world through the filters of&nbsp;their own experience and beliefs. Upbringing, education, and all the joys and failures that have ever happened to&nbsp;us make up&nbsp;the material of&nbsp;our reality tunnel. That’s why people often have different reactions to&nbsp;the same things.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life:</strong> Looking at&nbsp;the Mona Lisa, the famous painting by&nbsp;Leonardo DaVinci, one person will see a&nbsp;mysterious smile, another one will find mathematical perfection in&nbsp;it, while the third one will see a&nbsp;fat, browless woman. None of&nbsp;these people is&nbsp;mistaken because they all live in&nbsp;their own reality tunnels and strongly believe that they are right.</p><p>All this happens because, according to&nbsp;the reality tunnel theory, there is&nbsp;<a href=#>no&nbsp;common truth</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;impossible for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;exist because it’s very <a href=#>hard</a> to&nbsp;escape your own familiar, safe, and comfortable tunnel.</p><p><h2>4. Hedgehogs’ dilemma</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/499/f1e/35a7eb552d8b16b5cecf18eaca.jpg><p>People tend to&nbsp;stay close to&nbsp;each other; most of&nbsp;us need family and friends. However, intimate relationships are sometimes followed by&nbsp;pain. The imperfections of&nbsp;our loved ones may cause&nbsp;us to&nbsp;become estranged and move away. However, after some time, we&nbsp;make the same mistakes by&nbsp;searching for closeness and suffering from it&nbsp;later.</p><p>German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer called this the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hedgehogs’ dilemma</a> or&nbsp;the porcupine problem. He&nbsp;shared the following parable in&nbsp;his work:</p><p>“A&nbsp;number of&nbsp;porcupines huddled together for warmth on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold day in&nbsp;winter; but, as&nbsp;they began to&nbsp;prick one another with their quills, they were obliged to&nbsp;disperse. However, the cold drove them together again, when just the same thing happened. At&nbsp;last, after many turns of&nbsp;huddling and dispersing, they discovered that they would be&nbsp;best off by&nbsp;remaining at&nbsp;a&nbsp;little distance from one another. In&nbsp;the same way, the need of&nbsp;society drives the human porcupines together, only to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mutually repelled by&nbsp;the many prickly and disagreeable qualities of&nbsp;their nature.”</p><p><h2>5. Foot in&nbsp;the door</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d7/156/9fe2fd5223915f84d7ca74eec5.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first, a&nbsp;person does you a&nbsp;little favor and later you get trapped because their demands and requests become bolder and bolder, while you are not able to&nbsp;say, “No.” The trick called “<a href=#>foot-in-the-door</a>” is&nbsp;widely used by&nbsp;marketers who want to&nbsp;sell you their goods.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life: </strong>Service providers tell you, “Get a&nbsp;trial version of&nbsp;our program” or&nbsp;“Subscribe to&nbsp;our services&nbsp;— the first month of&nbsp;the subscription is&nbsp;free.” The consumer hasn’t paid a&nbsp;penny yet, but has already gotten trapped because it’s easier to&nbsp;sell the extended subscription to&nbsp;the one who has already tried the free version.</p><p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;seller is&nbsp;promising you a&nbsp;big discount or&nbsp;a&nbsp;deal a-la " Buy 3&nbsp;for the price of&nbsp;2," it&nbsp;means that they have read one of&nbsp;those psychological books and are trying to&nbsp;get their foot in&nbsp;your door. They are well aware that you’ll come again and spend a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;money in&nbsp;their shop.</p><p><h2>6. The theory of&nbsp;creeping normality</h2></p><p>People <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>are able</a> to&nbsp;accept the most terrible changes in&nbsp;their life calmly if&nbsp;these changes happen gradually.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life:</strong> Residents of&nbsp;big cities <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>are ready</a> to&nbsp;tolerate smog and environmental degradation in&nbsp;their city because these changes don’t happen quickly, and they have time <strong>to&nbsp;get used to&nbsp;the bad</strong>.</p><p>This theory can answer many questions&nbsp;— from big historical events to&nbsp;ordinary routine things. Why do&nbsp;people keep living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage that is&nbsp;destroying their psyche? The answer is&nbsp;quite simple: they got used to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and accepted it&nbsp;because the changes didn’t happen overnight. Their reality changed and slowly made abnormal things seem normal.</p><p><h2>7. The theory of&nbsp;anonymous authority</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/11c/8cd/42edf659caa6874647f5b17658.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;this <a href=#>theory</a>, it&nbsp;becomes easy to&nbsp;<a href=# title=manipulate data-link=tag>manipulate</a> people with the help of&nbsp;magic words. Phrases like “according to&nbsp;scientists” or&nbsp;“experts claim” <strong>that are not even backed up&nbsp;by&nbsp;obvious scientific research are easily perceived as&nbsp;truth. </strong>We&nbsp;subconsciously <a href=#>listen</a> to&nbsp;anonymous authority (an&nbsp;expert or&nbsp;a&nbsp;scientist) that might not even exist at&nbsp;all.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life:</strong> A&nbsp;commercial for pills says that the efficiency of&nbsp;this drug has been proven by&nbsp;scientists. It&nbsp;makes the viewer start to&nbsp;trust this statement. How can one not believe scientists?</p><p>Don’t trust depersonalized information. There are phrases used in&nbsp;commercials, on&nbsp;the internet, and in&nbsp;newspapers that are lies. Here are some of&nbsp;them:</p><ul><li>Phrases without precise numbers like, “most scientists” or&nbsp;"some people“(who are these people?)</li><li>Use of&nbsp;passive voice&nbsp;— “it&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered” (who considers&nbsp;it?)</li><li>Phrases like, “Up&nbsp;to&nbsp;100%” (is&nbsp;it&nbsp;2% or&nbsp;99%?)</li></ul><p>Ask for proof in&nbsp;any unknown situation and only trust those who can provide&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>8. Self-fulfilling prophecy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17d/294/9d7e3b537fafe0fe2932f592f7.jpg><p>Sometimes prophecies <a href=#>come true</a>, but there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;magic in&nbsp;it. The trick is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;you believe in&nbsp;this prophecy, it&nbsp;will happen. This paradox is&nbsp;actively used by&nbsp;fraudsters.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life:</strong> A&nbsp;fortune teller predicted to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man that he&nbsp;would end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the hospital in&nbsp;a&nbsp;day or&nbsp;2. So&nbsp;the impressed man goes on&nbsp;with his life, immersed in&nbsp;sad thoughts about a&nbsp;possible illness, and isn’t aware of&nbsp;his surroundings. Eventually, our hero slips, falls to&nbsp;the pavement, and ends up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the hospital with a&nbsp;sprained ankle. The “prophecy” of&nbsp;the fortune-teller did happen, but not because she can see the future&nbsp;— the man himself made the “prophecy” come true.</p><p>It’s enough for a&nbsp;person to&nbsp;subconsciously believe in&nbsp;someone else’s idea to&nbsp;begin to&nbsp;<a href=#>generate</a> thoughts that confirm this idea. Unfortunately, other people’s ideas are not always good. However, you can <a href=#>escape</a> a&nbsp;self-fulfilling prophecy if&nbsp;you try to&nbsp;create your own positive affirmations.</p><p><h2>9. Baby duck syndrome</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27e/016/dc6d3b5536a455abbb820e4011.jpg><p>A&nbsp;freshly hatched duckling takes the first moving object it&nbsp;sees for its mother and continues to&nbsp;follow it&nbsp;everywhere. A&nbsp;human, a&nbsp;dog, a&nbsp;goat, or&nbsp;even an&nbsp;inanimate object can serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“mother.” Scientists call this behavior “<a href=#>imprinting</a>” and they also say that all humans have this characteristic in&nbsp;themselves.</p><p>The baby duck syndrome <a href=#>appears</a> when a&nbsp;person encounters a&nbsp;new environment and starts to&nbsp;consider the object they see first as&nbsp;the best. Moreover, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very difficult to&nbsp;persuade this “duckling” to&nbsp;try something new and it’s almost impossible to&nbsp;prove that new things can be&nbsp;better than old ones.</p><p><strong>Here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example from real life:</strong> “Paper books are better than digital ones” or&nbsp;“Mobile phones with buttons are more reliable than sensor phones,” or&nbsp;“This new design is&nbsp;awful,”&nbsp;— these are the phrases indicating a&nbsp;person has baby duck syndrome.</p><p>This effect makes a&nbsp;person biased and hinders them from listening to&nbsp;the opinion of&nbsp;others. However, new things can be&nbsp;good and comfortable too.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these psychological laws have taken place in&nbsp;your life?

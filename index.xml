I&amp;nbsp;know, your first thought was probably a&amp;nbsp;whale or&amp;nbsp;some large tree, like the Sequoia. Surprisingly, if&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;look at&amp;nbsp;square footage, the largest single living organism is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;species of&amp;nbsp;mycelium called Armillaria Ostoyae or&amp;nbsp;the honey mushroom. And you can find it&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Oregon’s Malheur National Forest. It&amp;nbsp;stretches across 3&amp;nbsp;square miles! Not only is&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;the largest, but it’s also thought to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;the oldest organism as&amp;nbsp;well, estimated to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;around 8,000 years old! Some scientists believe that mushrooms are intelligent, too.</description></item><item><title>Why Peyton Manning Joked About Carrie Underwood at the CMAs</title><link>/why-peyton-manning-joked-about-carrie-underwood-at-the-cmas.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/why-peyton-manning-joked-about-carrie-underwood-at-the-cmas.html</guid><description>TALENTRECAP.COM Entertainment Celebrity

As early as 1440 the city of Aberdeen is known to have put on its own set of 'mystery plays' which were performed by the city's own craft guilds. The Halloween tradition of 'guising', which still exists today can also be traced back to these early performances.

An&amp;nbsp;Australian billionaire was sure that many people who were amazed by&amp;nbsp;the ill-fated ship would want to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;so, avoiding the tragic sinking, of&amp;nbsp;course. So&amp;nbsp;he’s started a&amp;nbsp;grandiose plan to&amp;nbsp;build the Titanic&amp;nbsp;II, a&amp;nbsp;precise copy of&amp;nbsp;the original ship.

However, a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;the times that’s not the case, and those people don’t deserve to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;treated like outcasts. All they’re guilty of&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;being different, probably even in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;positive way.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side think being the black sheep of&amp;nbsp;the family is&amp;nbsp;actually a&amp;nbsp;good thing in&amp;nbsp;many cases. And here’s why.

However, an&amp;nbsp;intriguing discovery made by&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;Twitter user sheds light on&amp;nbsp;something peculiar about his style evolution. Like a&amp;nbsp;chameleon, Pitt has adapted his looks over the years to&amp;nbsp;align with each new woman he&amp;nbsp;has been romantically involved with.
Shalene McCall
During Brad Pitt’s appearance in&amp;nbsp;four episodes of&amp;nbsp;Dallas in&amp;nbsp;1987, the actor, who was 24&amp;nbsp;years old at&amp;nbsp;the time, had a&amp;nbsp;controversial relationship with his co-star, Shalane McCall.</description></item><item><title>11 Celebrities Who Paused Their Career to Take Care of Their Families</title><link>/10-celebrities-who-decided-to-put-their-careers-on-hold-and-be-with-their-families-806948.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/10-celebrities-who-decided-to-put-their-careers-on-hold-and-be-with-their-families-806948.html</guid><description>When we&amp;nbsp;think of&amp;nbsp;celebrities, we&amp;nbsp;generally imagine their luxurious lives and we&amp;nbsp;frequently overlook the fact that they are people very much like&amp;nbsp;us. As&amp;nbsp;parents, they want to&amp;nbsp;raise their kids in&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;atmosphere where they aren’t criticized or&amp;nbsp;labeled “privileged” just because their parents are. That’s why a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;celebrities gave up&amp;nbsp;their career to&amp;nbsp;raise their children.

But, as&amp;nbsp;the movie was shot between July and August 2013, they were actually younger. Anyway, that’s a&amp;nbsp;34-year age difference. And this isn’t an&amp;nbsp;anomaly. It&amp;nbsp;happens far more often than you can imagine.

And we&amp;nbsp;were able to&amp;nbsp;somehow avoid these activities in&amp;nbsp;childhood and still have everything in&amp;nbsp;apple-pie order (thanks to&amp;nbsp;our parents).

As&amp;nbsp;Oscar Wilde once said, “Sarcasm is&amp;nbsp;the lowest form of&amp;nbsp;wit, but the highest form of&amp;nbsp;intelligence.” Many people will use this tool to&amp;nbsp;make fun of&amp;nbsp;themselves and an&amp;nbsp;aspect of&amp;nbsp;their lives that they realize could be&amp;nbsp;better. The results are usually super funny, creating a&amp;nbsp;whirlwind of&amp;nbsp;mixed emotions.

Moreover, they’re split along party lines: Republicans are more likely than voters overall to oppose a repeal, while Democrats and Tea Party supporters – an unlikely combination – are more likely to support a repeal.</description></item><item><title>What do lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Britons think the British public thinks of them?</title><link>/45983-what-do-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-brito.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/45983-what-do-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-brito.html</guid><description>Gay and lesbian Britons tend to think the public has a favourable view of them, but bisexual and particularly transgender Britons feel less positivity from the publicA new YouGov survey shows that, among gay and lesbian Britons, 54% believe the public has a positive view of lesbian and gay people, with a further 26% believing they take a neither positive or negative view.

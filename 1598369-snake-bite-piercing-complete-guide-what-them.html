Such foods include yoghurt, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoothies, and soups. Drinking plenty of water also helps keep your mouth clean and reduces swelling.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, it is advisable to stay away from hot beverages, alcohol, spicy foods, and tobacco products as they can irritate the piercing and prolong healing.

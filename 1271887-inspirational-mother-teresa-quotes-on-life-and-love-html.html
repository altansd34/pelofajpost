I’m not here just to fill a place, just to be a number. He has chosen me for a purpose. I know it.</li><li>At the heart of silence is prayer. At the heart of prayer is faith. At the heart of faith is life. At the heart of life is service.</li><li>Prayer is as necessary as the air, as the blood in our bodies, as anything to keep us alive – to keep us alive to the grace of God.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/027ba1dbf0c4482e_w.png><ul><li>Faith is a gift of God. Without it, there would be no life. And our work, to be fruitful, and to be all for God, and to be beautiful, has to be built on faith — faith in Christ, who has said, I was hungry, I was naked, I was sick, and I was homeless, and you ministered to me. On these words of His, our work is based.</li><li>I always begin my prayer in silence, for it is in the silence of the heart that God speaks. God is the friend of silence – we need to listen to God because it's not what we say but he says to us and through us that matters.</li><li>Every human being has a longing for God. Christians go one step further—not only do we long for God but we have the treasure of his presence always with us.</li><li>Love to pray. Take the trouble to pray. Prayer opens your heart until it is big enough to hold and keep God. We must know Jesus in prayer before we can see him in the broken bodies of the poor.</li><li>If you feel unimportant in the eyes of the world, that matters not at all. For God, there is no one any more important in the entire world than you.</li><li>May God break my heart so completely that the whole world falls in.</li><li>Souls without prayer are like people whose limbs are p*ralyzed; they possess but can’t control them.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/92c36b98fcd756fd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75 amazing husband quotes to say you love him</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2c5e45cbda8b6036.png><ul><li>There are more tears shed over answered prayers than over unanswered prayers.</li><li>Deep down in every human heart, there is knowledge of God. And deep down in every human heart is the desire to communicate with Him.</li><li>If we neglect prayer and if the branch is not connected with the vine, it will die. That connecting of the branch to the vine is prayer. If that connection is there then love is there, then joy is there, and we will be the sunshine of God’s love, the hope of eternal happiness, the flame of burning love. Why? Because we are one with Jesus. If you sincerely want to learn to pray: keep silence.</li></ul><h2>Mother Teresa quotes do it anyway</h2><p class=align-left>These are probably her most impactful quotes of them all.

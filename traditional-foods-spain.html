<time>04 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>If you’re interested in Spanish cuisine, you may have already sampled some of the country’s traditional dishes. But while Spain is known for its fragrant seafood <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paellas</a> and elaborate tapas, what really lies at the heart of Spanish cuisine? Rustic charm.&nbsp;</p><p>Many traditional foods in Spain, from crunchy pimientos de Padrón to piquant patatas bravas, require only simple and fresh ingredients. This makes for a particularly homey and welcoming cuisine — which we’ll explore in this list of 10 delicious foods eaten in Spain for breakfast, lunch and dinner!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Traditional-Spanish-breakfast->Traditional Spanish breakfast&nbsp;</h2><p>So, what does the Spanish mesa del desayuno (breakfast table) look like? Let’s explore!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pan con tomate (literally ‘bread with tomato’)</h3><p>This breakfast dish is very easy to prepare: just toast bread, rub on fresh garlic, drizzle some olive oil and add ripe tomatoes on top. This simple and healthy toast, or tostada, will surely put you in a great mood for the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Just don’t confuse the Spanish tostada (toasted bread) with the Mexican tostada (crunchy, fried tortilla), as they are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">completely different</a> foods.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tortilla de patatas/tortilla española (potato omelet/Spanish omelet)</h3><p>If you prefer a larger breakfast, Spanish tortilla (omelet) will certainly be for you. All you need for this dish are potatoes, onions and eggs — though you can also add some jamón (Spanish ham) for an even more unmistakable Spanish flavor!&nbsp;</p><p>As with the tostada, it’s important not to confuse different types of tortilla. The Spanish tortilla is very different from the Mexican tortilla (cooked corn or flour dough).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Churros (Spanish donut)</h3><p>Similar to a donut, churros are made of water, flour, sugar and salt. They are extruded and fried in oil in a long, snake-like shape.&nbsp;</p><p>In Spain, churros are traditionally served with a cup of hot, melted chocolate. The specific size varies across regions, but the taste is always delicious. Churros con chocolate is the perfect breakfast after a long night of partying in Madrid’s famous dance clubs.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bonus: Traditional Spanish breakfast drinks</h3><p>Many Spaniards opt for an ultra-light breakfast and a much heavier lunch, but one thing that can never be skipped is coffee!&nbsp;</p><p>The most popular type of coffee in Spain is the classic café con leche (coffee with milk). Other coffee options include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>café solo (espresso)</li><li>café cortado (espresso “cut” with a small amount of milk)</li><li>café manchado (a milky latte; literally “stained coffee”)</li><li>café carajillo (coffee with rum or whisky)</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Traditional-Spanish-appetizers-and-tapas>Traditional Spanish appetizers and tapas</h2><p>Let’s now look at the famous Spanish appetizers known as tapas. In some parts of the world, tapas have become a popular culinary trend. Named tapas because they were originally served on small plates <strong>covering or topping </strong>a beer at the bar, today these snacks can be found in the traditional style or as raciones (full rations) to share.</p><p>Some common Spanish tapas include:&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Jamón (cured country ham)</h3><p>Cured ham is a source of national pride and a welcome addition to any Spanish breakfast or dinner. While there are two major types of jamón (serrano and ibérico), jamón serrano is the umbrella term. You’ll likely see chefs slicing off portions of a large leg of ham onto a plate with a long, thin knife.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Croquetas (croquettes)</h3><p>Croquettes are any filling (jamón, cheese, fish, etc.) mixed with white bechamel sauce, coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried. This is a popular national tapa that pairs perfectly with Spanish vino (wine).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp)</h3><p>Gambas al ajillo is a delicacy of large shrimps cooked in plenty of garlic and olive oil. The best way to savor them is with some fresh, crispy bread!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pimientos de Padrón (Padrón peppers)</h3><p>Among the most delicious Spanish tapas, these small green peppers owe their name to the Padrón municipality in Galicia. They are delightfully easy to cook! All you need are three ingredients: salt, olive oil and those juicy green peppers, of course! The peppers are flash-fried and then salted while the oil is still hot, so they remain crispy and perfect for pairing with a draft beer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Traditional-Spanish-lunch-and-dinner-foods>Traditional Spanish lunch and dinner foods</h2><p>Lunch is the largest meal of the day in Spain. A typical Spanish comida (lunch) consists of a tapa (appetizer), a first course, a main dish of fish or meat, and a dessert, which may include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh fruit</a> or a flan (custard with caramel).&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look at some of the traditional dishes eaten for lunch or dinner in Spain:</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Gazpacho (cold tomato soup)</h3><p>Originating in sunny Andalucía, this delicious cold soup is known all over the world as a Spanish national dish. Made of blended red and green vegetables like tomatoes and peppers, gazpacho is loaded with vitamins. And what can be more refreshing than a cup of gazpacho in the middle of a sizzling summer day in Málaga?&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Paella (saffron rice)</h3><p>If you’re looking for an absolute classic, nothing beats Spanish paella! With its delicious and delicate flavor of saffron, paella is a must if you’re exploring Spanish cuisine. The original Valencian paella includes rice, beans and chicken or duck, while other versions focus on seafood.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Patatas bravas (spicy potatoes)</h3><p>This is a simple yet finger-licking dish, evocative of winter nights in the Spanish countryside. Though the dish is said to have originated around Madrid, make no mistake: patatas bravas are popular across the whole country.&nbsp;</p><p>To make patatas bravas, you’ll need crispy potatoes and a hot tomato pepper sauce. Have you noticed that tomatoes and peppers are main ingredients in a number of traditional Spanish dishes? If you have those ingredients on hand, you can whip up a few Spanish recipes in your own home!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘¡Buen provecho!’&nbsp;</h2><p>Exploring Spanish cuisine can be a fantastic thrill — especially if you use it as an opportunity to practice your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish language</a> skills. Being able to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">order food</a> in Spanish, discuss cuisine with locals or cook a recipe will certainly open up a whole new world to you. So, brush up your Spanish vocabulary and get ready to savor traditional foods in Spain, whether at home or in a restaurant! ¡Buen provecho!

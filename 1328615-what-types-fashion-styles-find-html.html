Any clothing item that was made before the 1990s is vintage clothing.</p><p class=align-left>Items from the 1920s or earlier are known as antique clothing. Vintage fashion is also called retro or retrospective style.</p><p class=align-left>Vintage-inspired pieces <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">are mostly used</a> for costume parties. However, some people like to dress in cute dresses from the past, and they sure do make a statement.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/de84b1a1d8d53294.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top-5 styles of ladies trousers you will love</span></p></a><h3>Artsy fashion style</h3><p class=align-left>The artsy look is one of the unique fashion styles because it invokes an independent creativity of each individual. The wearer is the one who wants to make a statement using their fashion choices.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, the individual creates their look. They do not follow the traditional norms. Instead, they pave a unique path for themselves.</p><p class=align-left>Their unconventional love for art leads to the creation of varied and interesting forms of trends, which are not restricted to something specific as many other looks are.</p><h3>The Bohemian look</h3><p class=align-left>The Boho pattern consists of very many wild and intricate patterns as well as exotic textures. Wearers of this look give the impression of being hippie and gyps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5cbf700002c579ea.jpg><p class=align-left>The look was popularized during the 1960s and 1970s, even though it may have existed long before this period. The classic Bohemian look has always stood out.</p><p class=align-left>The focus is on free and flowing fabrics, chains, fringes, and other eye-catching accessories.

It is a look that describes a fashionable person, but it does not necessarily mean that they have to wear the latest and hottest looks.</p><p class=align-left>People who follow this fashion normally choose well-tailored and stylish designs that are very classy. They often select strong and bold colors.</p><h3>The sexy look</h3><p class=align-left>The sexy look is all about showing off your best features. For women, it is about showing off the best things about your body to capture the attention of males.</p><p class=align-left>Heels and short or tight skirts mainly accompany it. It leaves the bare minimum for imagination because as much skin as possible is shown.</p><p class=align-left>Tight-fitting items are chosen to show off oneâ€™s best features, such as breasts and hips. This type of fashion is not for every woman as it requires a lot of guts to pull off.</p><h3>Casual fashion style</h3><p class=align-left>Casual wear means styling with comfort. The look is about picking clothes that will not cause too much of a stir for trendsetters, but are ideal for those everyday trips. The main focus is on durability and getting the perfect fit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2h5r91bgedfg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Get inspired by the best Ankara styles for pregnant ladies</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/de84b1a1d8d53294.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It is suitable</a> for people who dress up according to their mood without making too much effort. It has a sense of elegance and subtle grace.</p><h3>The sophisticated/classy look</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This look </a>has existed for decades, and it does not pay attention to the latest trends. Instead, it offers a sense of stability and comfort by focusing on simple elegance.</p><p class=align-left>It mainly involves impeccable tailoring and clean, straight lines. The chosen pieces work all year round.</p><p class=align-left>An example is pairing a striped top with dark washed denim and adding a few feminine details.

Even the most stylish girls have days when all they want is to unleash their inner tomboy by wearing menswear-type of trousers, suits, sneakers, buttoned-up shirts, and similar clothing items.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6880685060da3667.jpg><p class=align-left>In the tomboy look, one does not abide by the usual norms of what a woman should wear.

Identify the colors that inspire you</h3><p class=align-left>Colors influence how you feel. If you do not use many colors in your current wardrobe, you can start experimenting by adding a few colorful accessories then gauge how you feel.</p><p class=align-left>It is also essential to create your color palette. Know whether you like warm neutral tones, the poppy summer shades, or even the blacks and the whites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2h5r91bgedfg.jpg><h3>4. Look through your wardrobe</h3><p class=align-left>Look at the clothes you bought over the last few years, and take note of the ones you repeat the most. Take stock of the unopened pile as well as the impulsive purchases.</p><p class=align-left>All your clothes have something to tell about you, but the most repeated clothes will direct you towards the style you prefer.</p><p class=align-left>The next step is donating or swapping any pieces that you know do not work for you.

With fewer pieces, it is easier to get variations that build your unique fashion sense.</p><h3>5. Spare some time to gather your looks</h3><p class=align-left>Take a trip down the memory lane, and make a folder with some of your pictures from the past.

Identify and think about your fashion icons</h3><p class=align-left>Who is the one person, whether dead or alive, that you look up to as a fashion icon?

After some time, you will notice that you have a pattern.</p><p class=align-left>This will help you to know what you like. You should always look at your scrapbook or pinned items before you go shopping.</p><p class=align-left>Doing so will help you to stop running for all the fashionable pieces that may not match your authentic style.</p><h3>8. What are your ideologies?</h3><p class=align-left>You must know what your beliefs are when it comes to fashion.

Determine which brands are your favorite</h3><p class=align-left>If you believe that certain brands enhance your personality, choose those. If you do not care much about the brand and comfort is your top priority, it is also okay.</p><h3>11. Identify the accessories you prefer</h3><p class=align-left>Some people prefer chunky necklaces and earrings while others prefer the less conspicuous pieces. Your accessories speak volumes about your personality and sense of fashion.</p><p class=align-left>Look at your jewelry box and take note of the pieces you use often and those you are hesitant to wear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d35a594fe53667fd.jpg><h3>12. Have at least one signature item</h3><p class=align-left>Every fashionable human being <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">owns a signature item</a> that becomes part of their identity.
